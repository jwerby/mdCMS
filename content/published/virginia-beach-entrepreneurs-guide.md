# Virginia Beach Entrepreneurs: An Insider's Guide to Building Here

When we opened 1701 in the ViBe Creative District in 2016, people told us Virginia Beach wasn't ready for a coworking space. Seven years and 750+ businesses later, we'd proven them wrong. But we also learned exactly what Virginia Beach entrepreneurs need and what's still missing.

This isn't a city promotional piece or a bootcamp advertisement. It's an honest insider's guide to building a business in Virginia Beach, written by founders who spent nearly a decade supporting Virginia Beach entrepreneurs in the trenches.

## The State of Virginia Beach's Startup Scene

### What the Numbers Say

Virginia Beach's startup ecosystem has grown significantly over the past several years. Tech startups contributed $1.5 billion to the city's GDP in 2023, representing a 35% increase year over year. The broader tech sector now contributes $3.2 billion annually, accounting for roughly 15% of the total local economy.

Since 2020, the city has seen a 28% increase in new startups. Over 400 emerging tech companies now call Virginia Beach home, with particular strength in cybersecurity, fintech, and AI/ML. Virginia ranked #1 in CNBC's Top States for Business 2024, a validation of the broader business environment.

The numbers are genuinely impressive. But they only tell part of the story.

### What the Numbers Don't Tell You

Behind every statistic is a founder who faced real challenges building here. Virginia Beach has incredible talent, but we continue to lose people to DC, Richmond, and Charlotte. The metro area ranks #37 in size nationally but only #70 in startup ecosystem strength. That gap tells you something important.

The missing piece isn't talented people or good ideas. It's infrastructure. Physical spaces where founders can connect. Early-stage capital to get companies off the ground. Density of networks where serendipitous connections happen naturally.

We watched this dynamic play out at [1701, Virginia Beach's first coworking space](https://arrivalvb.com/1701), for seven years. The demand was always there. What Virginia Beach entrepreneurs needed was a place to find each other.

## Resources for Virginia Beach Entrepreneurs

### Government Programs

**The HIVE** is Virginia Beach's primary small business support center. Located in the Virginia Beach Central Library, The HIVE offers free services including business counseling, workshops, and networking events. In 2023 alone, they assisted over 1,770 clients, delivered 343 business workshops, created 65 business plans, and helped 42 new businesses launch. If you're just starting a business in Virginia Beach, The HIVE should be your first stop.

**The UPLIFT Virginia Beach Accelerator Program** provides structured support for growth-stage companies. The program includes mentorship, training, and access to resources designed to help businesses scale.

**SWaM Certification** (Small, Women-owned, and Minority-owned) opens doors to government contracting opportunities. In 2023, The HIVE helped complete 204 SWaM certifications. For eligible businesses, this certification can be transformational.

**Small Business Grants** are available for qualified businesses, with awards up to $10,000 through various city programs. Check the [City of Virginia Beach Small Business Resources](https://virginiabeach.gov/services/launch-virginia-beach/small-business-resources) page for current opportunities.

### Private Ecosystem

**[757 Accelerate](https://www.innovate757.org)** stands out as a nonprofit accelerator that takes no equity from participating companies. The program provides mentorship, curriculum, and funding access. Lisa DeNoia serves on the 757 Accelerate board, and we've seen firsthand how the program helps founders develop both their businesses and their skills.

**757 Angels** is a network of accredited investors focused on Hampton Roads startups. For companies ready to raise, connecting with this group can provide both capital and strategic guidance.

**[SCORE Hampton Roads](https://www.score.org/hamptonroads)** offers free mentorship from experienced business professionals. Whether you need help with a business plan, financial projections, or strategic decisions, SCORE mentors bring real-world experience to the table.

### What's Missing

Here's the honest assessment: after [1701's seven-year run ended](https://arrivalvb.com/1701/impact), Virginia Beach lost its primary community-focused coworking space. The city still lacks a dedicated hub where Virginia Beach entrepreneurs can work, connect, and build relationships organically.

The gap isn't just about desks. It's about density. In mature startup ecosystems, founders bump into each other constantly. They grab coffee and discover shared interests. They attend the same events and build trust over time. That density of interaction is harder to replicate in Virginia Beach right now.

Early-stage capital remains scarce. While 757 Angels provides one pathway, the region lacks the depth of seed-stage investors you'd find in major metros. Many founders who could build here end up relocating to access capital networks in DC or other cities.

## Virginia Beach Success Stories

### Tech Winners

The region has produced genuine success stories that demonstrate what's possible for Virginia Beach entrepreneurs who choose to build here.

**DroneUp** raised a $27.2 million Series C and has become a leader in drone delivery and services. Originally founded in Virginia Beach, the company has grown to employ hundreds and serves major clients including Walmart. Their success demonstrates that Virginia Beach can produce companies competing at the national level.

**DOMA Technologies** has added over 300 new jobs while building enterprise content management solutions. The company exemplifies how B2B tech businesses can thrive in Virginia Beach, leveraging proximity to government clients and defense contractors.

**Decisions** has raised $40 million in funding for their no-code business automation platform. Founded in Virginia Beach in 2010, the company now serves Fortune 500 corporations across healthcare, finance, and logistics on almost every continent. Their growth demonstrates that enterprise SaaS companies can scale globally from Virginia Beach.

**Valkyrie Enterprises** grew from 5 employees in 2007 to over 800 today, with $200 million in annual revenue. This veteran-owned defense contractor provides mission support services to the DoD and aerospace clients. They received a $125,000 grant from Virginia Beach for expansion creating 100 new jobs at $75K+ average salaries.

**ICI Services Corporation** is an employee-owned defense contractor founded in Virginia Beach in 1999. With 500+ employees and operations in 14 states, they provide specialized engineering and unmanned surface vehicle solutions for the U.S. Navy and Department of Homeland Security. Twenty-five years of continuous growth speaks to what's possible when companies commit to building here.

**Hush Aerospace** represents Virginia Beach's growing uncrewed systems cluster. Founded in 2019, they operate an 88,000 square foot manufacturing facility designing multi-modal drones for commercial and industrial applications. They're currently developing a drone-and-drop system for Virginia Beach beaches to rescue distressed swimmers.

### Community-Built Businesses

The stories we know best are the ones we watched unfold at 1701. Over seven years, [more than 750 businesses](https://arrivalvb.com/1701/impact) came through our doors. Forty of those grew successful enough to graduate to their own dedicated office space.

These weren't all tech startups. They were marketing consultants and photographers. Accountants and designers. People who needed a professional space to work and a community to belong to. Many are still operating in Virginia Beach today, part of the business fabric we helped weave.

The lesson from 1701 was clear: Virginia Beach entrepreneurs don't lack ambition or talent. They lack infrastructure that makes building easier.

## The Real Challenges Virginia Beach Entrepreneurs Face

### Why Entrepreneurs Leave

Let's talk honestly about why talented people leave Virginia Beach.

**The DC pull is real.** The nation's capital offers higher salaries, more investors, and denser networks. For ambitious people early in their careers, the opportunity cost of staying can feel significant.

**Richmond and Charlotte offer alternatives.** Both cities have invested heavily in startup infrastructure. They've built the physical and social systems that make entrepreneurship easier. For founders comparing options, Virginia Beach doesn't always win.

**Physical infrastructure gaps persist.** After 1701's closure, options for community-focused workspace in Virginia Beach are more limited. Gather offers professional coworking in Town Center and Norfolk, but Regus-style locations offer desks without community. The region's #70 startup ranking reflects this reality.

### What Would Change the Game

Based on our experience supporting hundreds of Virginia Beach entrepreneurs, here's what would meaningfully shift the ecosystem:

**More physical gathering spaces.** Not just desk rental, but true community hubs where entrepreneurs work alongside each other, attend programming together, and build relationships over time. The coworking model works in Virginia Beach; we proved that at 1701. The city needs more of it.



**Stronger founder networks.** Formal programs like 757 Accelerate help, but informal networks matter too. Regular meetups. Industry-specific groups. Spaces where people run into each other repeatedly and trust builds naturally.

**Early-stage funding ecosystem.** Angel investors, micro-VCs, and family offices willing to write checks for pre-seed and seed-stage companies. Without local capital, founders have to leave to raise, and many don't come back.

**Year-round programming beyond the beach.** Virginia Beach positions itself as a resort destination, but entrepreneurs need reasons to stay engaged all year. Innovation programming, tech events, and founder communities that maintain momentum through the off-season.

Our [Arrival proposal](https://arrivalvb.com/proposal) addressed many of these gaps directly. The concept was designed to create exactly this kind of year-round, multi-use infrastructure for Virginia Beach's innovation community.

## How to Get Started in Virginia Beach

### If You're Just Starting Out

**Start at The HIVE.** Their counselors can help you refine your idea, develop a business plan, and connect with relevant resources. The services are free, and the guidance is practical.

**Attend local events.** 757 Accelerate hosts regular programming. The Hampton Roads Chamber runs networking events. CreativeMornings Virginia Beach brings together creative professionals monthly. Show up consistently and you'll start building your network.

**Consider SCORE mentorship.** Having an experienced mentor review your business plan and challenge your assumptions can save you from costly mistakes. The mentors are volunteers who genuinely want to help.

**Get your certifications.** If you qualify for SWaM certification, start that process early. Government contracting opportunities can provide stable revenue while you build.

### If You're Growing

**Apply to 757 Accelerate.** The structured program, mentorship, and community can accelerate your growth. The no-equity model means you keep full ownership.

**Connect with 757 Angels.** If you're ready to raise capital, getting on their radar early gives you time to build relationships before you need to close a round.

**Look for strategic partners.** Hampton Roads has strong presence in defense, maritime, and healthcare. If your business serves those industries, the customer base is here.

**Engage with economic development.** The city actively wants to retain growing businesses. Programs and incentives exist for companies creating jobs locally.

### If You're Relocating Here

**Understand the ecosystem honestly.** Virginia Beach offers quality of life, lower cost of living than DC or major metros, and genuine opportunity. But the startup infrastructure is still developing. Come with realistic expectations.

**Connect before you arrive.** Reach out to local founders, join online communities, and attend events virtually if possible. Having a network in place makes the transition easier.

**Plug into the ViBe District.** The ViBe Creative District on the Oceanfront has become a hub for creative businesses. [Fathom Coffee](https://arrivalvb.com/portfolio/fathom-coffee), our specialty coffee roastery, is part of that community. The district has energy and momentum.

**Bring your network with you.** One of Virginia Beach's advantages is that remote work has made location more flexible. If you're building a distributed company, you can access talent anywhere while enjoying Virginia Beach's quality of life.

## The Future of Virginia Beach Entrepreneurship

The ecosystem is genuinely improving. Virginia Beach competed in the Startup World Cup, a signal that the city takes entrepreneurship seriously. New programs continue to launch. The tech sector's contribution to local GDP keeps growing.

[Lisa DeNoia was named Hampton Roads Entrepreneur of the Year](https://arrivalvb.com/about/lisa-denoia) in 2018 for the work we did building 1701 and supporting the local community. That recognition reflected not just our effort, but the broader momentum building in Virginia Beach at that time.

> **"Our survey for the Arrival project showed 86% positive response from Virginia Beach residents who said they'd use a community hub. Live events, coworking, and community programming topped their wish lists. The demand exists."**

---

The community is ready. What we need now is investment in the infrastructure to serve that demand. Physical spaces. Programming. Networks. The building blocks that turn talented individuals into a thriving ecosystem.

## Conclusion

Virginia Beach has real advantages for entrepreneurs: quality of life, growing tech sector, supportive programs like The HIVE and 757 Accelerate, and a community that wants to see local businesses succeed.

It also has real gaps: limited physical infrastructure, sparse early-stage capital, and networks that aren't yet dense enough to generate the serendipity that mature ecosystems enjoy.

We spent seven years learning these lessons at 1701. We supported 750+ businesses and watched 40+ grow successful enough to graduate to their own spaces. We know what Virginia Beach entrepreneurs need because we've been serving them.

**Key resources to explore:**

Virginia Beach has the potential to be a great place to build a business. Getting there requires honest assessment of what's working, what's missing, and what the community needs to reach its potential.

We're still here, still building, and still committed to Virginia Beach's entrepreneurial future. [Learn more about our journey](https://arrivalvb.com/about).
