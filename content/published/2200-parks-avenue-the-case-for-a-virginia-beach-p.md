The building at 2200 Parks Avenue has stood at Virginia Beach's gateway to the Oceanfront since 1989. For over three decades, it operated as one of the region's most successful public-private partnerships. The city owned the land and building. A nonprofit operated the programming. The community benefited.

Now, as Virginia MOCA relocates to Virginia Wesleyan University and the building becomes available for new uses, a fundamental question faces Virginia Beach: What model should govern this property's next chapter?

We believe the answer is clear. A public-private partnership combining technology, arts, culinary innovation, and community programming represents the optimal path forward. This isn't speculation. It's a conclusion drawn from three sources of evidence: 35 years of proven success at this exact location, Virginia Beach's track record with seven successful P3 facilities, and national data showing community hubs generate $3.40 in economic returns for every dollar of public investment.

This article presents that evidence. We document what worked, what happened with the recent RFI process, what questions remain unanswered, and how a successful P3 should be structured. We're not here to assign blame or demand action. We're here to provide the most comprehensive resource available on why public-private partnership is the right model for 2200 Parks Avenue.

## Part 1: The Precedent

### 35 Years of Proof at 2200 Parks Avenue

The strongest argument for a P3 at 2200 Parks Avenue is that one already worked here for 35 years.

When the Virginia Beach Center for the Arts opened in September 1989, it represented everything a public-private partnership should be. The City of Virginia Beach owned both the land and the 38,500-square-foot building. The nonprofit Virginia Museum of Contemporary Art operated the facility under a lease arrangement that cost just $1 per year. The city maintained the building and grounds at approximately $200,000 annually, while MOCA delivered programming, exhibitions, and community events without the burden of property ownership.

This arrangement wasn't controversial. It wasn't experimental. It was, as one local arts organization described it, "one of the region's best examples of a private-public partnership."

The P3 model at 2200 Parks Avenue delivered consistent results across three and a half decades:

- Continuous cultural programming serving Virginia Beach residents and visitors
- A stable tenant that didn't burden the city budget with operational costs
- Community access to exhibitions, education, and events
- A well-maintained facility at Virginia Beach's most visible gateway location
- Private philanthropy supplementing public investment (including the 1999 Rodriguez Pavilion expansion funded entirely by private donors)

When MOCA announced in July 2023 that it would relocate to a new purpose-built facility at Virginia Wesleyan University, the city faced a transition, not a crisis. The building remained in good condition. The P3 model had proven sustainable. The question was simply: what organization and programming mix would serve Virginia Beach's next 35 years?

### How the MOCA Building Came to Be

The story of 2200 Parks Avenue begins decades before the 1989 opening. Understanding this history reveals how deeply the public-private model is embedded in this property's DNA.

Virginia MOCA's roots trace back to the 1950s, when local artists formed the Virginia Beach Art Association and began hosting an annual Boardwalk Art Show. For years, that event raised funds and built awareness for a future art facility. By the 1970s, the Virginia Beach Arts Center was operating out of a small former municipal building at 1916 Arctic Avenue near the Oceanfront. The desire for a larger, purpose-built museum grew throughout the 1980s.

From the outset, the project was conceived as a public-private partnership. Substantial private donations and community fundraising, including proceeds from the Boardwalk Art Show and capital campaigns, were crucial in financing the new museum. At the same time, the City of Virginia Beach and the Commonwealth of Virginia provided major support.

In 1985, the City Council discussed establishing a $1.5 million "challenge grant" for the Arts Center, contingent on matching funds from the state. This plan came to fruition a few years later: by 1988, the Virginia Governor's budget included $1.5 million earmarked for the Virginia Beach Arts Center. City officials indicated that those state funds, paired with the city's own contribution, would help realize the new building.

The site selection tells its own story. The nearly 10-acre parcel at 2200 Parks Avenue sits at the western gateway to the resort area, near the foot of Interstate 264. Prior to construction, much of this land was undeveloped and wooded, with a tidal channel running through a portion of it. In the mid-1980s, the city and museum backers assembled the necessary parcels. Local property owners actively helped consolidate and convey the land for the new museum. The City of Virginia Beach took ownership and prepared it for construction.

Designed by Boston architect E. Verner Johnson & Associates, a specialist in museum design, the building features distinctive white brick with granite accents and a dramatic copper-clad hip-roofed entrance canopy. Inside, the layout includes roughly 6,300 square feet of gallery space, a 300-seat auditorium, studio classrooms for art education, and administrative offices. The galleries were equipped with movable walls and controlled natural light via clerestory windows, state-of-the-art features for the time.

When it opened in September 1989, the facility stood as proof that public investment and private initiative could combine to create lasting community infrastructure. The City of Virginia Beach owned both the land and the building. The nonprofit museum operated it for a nominal fee. Citizens funded ongoing operations through local government grants from the Arts & Humanities Commission in addition to state and federal arts grants and private donations.

This blend of revenue sustained the museum for decades.

### The P3 Model Already Proved Itself Here

The significance of this history cannot be overstated. When we discuss whether a public-private partnership should govern 2200 Parks Avenue's future, we're not debating an untested theory. We're asking whether to continue a model that worked at this exact location for 35 years.

Consider what the P3 achieved:

**Stability**: MOCA operated continuously from 1989 through 2025, navigating economic downturns, changing arts landscapes, and evolving community needs without requiring city bailouts or operational takeovers.

**Private Investment**: The 1999 Rodriguez Pavilion expansion was funded entirely through private donations. Named in honor of a lead donor, it added a secondary entrance lobby, additional facilities, and enabled installation of a 14-foot blown glass chandelier by artist Dale Chihuly. The city didn't fund this expansion. Private philanthropy did, because the P3 structure enabled it.

**Accreditation**: In 2010, the institution achieved accreditation from the American Alliance of Museums, becoming the Virginia Museum of Contemporary Art. This milestone reflected professional standards maintained under the P3 arrangement.

**Community Benefit**: For 35 years, the building hosted exhibitions, educational programs, and community events. Generations of Virginia Beach residents and visitors experienced cultural programming because a nonprofit partner activated public infrastructure.

The P3 at 2200 Parks Avenue wasn't perfect. No arrangement spanning three decades could be. But it functioned. The city retained ownership. The community received programming. Private donors invested. The building was maintained.

Any discussion of this property's future should start from this foundation: the public-private partnership model is not theoretical here. It's historical fact.

## Part 2: The Process

### What Happened with the RFI

We have a particular perspective on this story. We submitted a proposal for this building through the city's formal RFI process. We were invited to interview. And then, along with all other applicants, we received notice that the city had canceled the solicitation entirely.

We're documenting what happened because we believe the community deserves transparency about decisions affecting public property. We're not assigning blame or speculating about motives. We're presenting facts.

**The Timeline**

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| July 2023 | Virginia MOCA announces relocation to Virginia Wesleyan University |
| August 2024 | Groundbreaking for new MOCA facility; City receives unsolicited proposals |
| February 2025 | City Council agrees to issue formal Request for Information (RFI) |
| April 1, 2025 | Central Beach Small Area Plan preferred alternative presented to City Council |
| June 9, 2025 | RFI submission deadline |
| August 22, 2025 | Interviews conducted with evaluation committee |
| September 19, 2025 | City cancels RFI ED-25-01 |

On September 19, 2025, the City of Virginia Beach formally canceled RFI ED-25-01. The cancellation letter, signed by Pamela Witham, Senior Planner in Economic Development, stated:

> "After thoughtful review and deliberation, the City of Virginia Beach has decided to cancel this solicitation and explore other options that more closely align with its current vision for the property."

The letter also noted: "This was not an easy decision, as the RFI process attracted a number of strong and compelling submissions."

**What the Cancellation Means**

- No applicant was selected
- All proposals were rejected
- The city intends to pursue a different approach
- No public explanation of what that approach will be

### Our Experience with the Process

We submitted an [85-page proposal](/downloads/Arrival-proposal.pdf) for a community hub concept that would combine coworking, arts programming, culinary innovation, and community events. Our proposal built on seven years of experience operating [1701](/1701), Virginia Beach's first coworking space, where we supported over 750 businesses and helped more than 40 graduate to their own dedicated office locations.

In July 2025, we received an invitation to interview. The email from the evaluation committee stated they were "impressed with your proposed use for the space and team assembled."

On August 22, 2025, we presented to the evaluation committee. The 45-minute interview included a 20-minute presentation and 20-minute Q&A. The cancellation letter later noted that "the panel thoroughly enjoyed your presentation and the engaging conversation."

We share this not to argue we should have been selected, but to document that the process proceeded through interviews before being canceled entirely. We've made our full proposal public so the community can see what was on the table.

### The Unanswered Questions

Several significant questions remain unanswered:

**1. What does "operational agreement" mean?**

The Central Beach Small Area Plan's language, discussed below, suggests a different arrangement than the lease model the RFI sought. This phrase may be key to understanding the city's intentions, but no public clarification has been provided.

**2. What happens next?**

No public announcement of next steps has been made since the September 2025 cancellation. No news coverage of the cancellation has been published.

**3. Why cancel rather than proceed?**

The RFI sought cultural and community use. The Central Beach Small Area Plan calls for cultural and community use. What specifically didn't align between the submissions and the city's vision?

**4. What's the timeline?**

When will the city announce its approach? When might programming resume at the building? MOCA's lease ended April 30, 2025. How long will this significant public asset sit vacant?

These gaps could potentially be addressed through FOIA requests, monitoring City Council agendas, or direct inquiry to Economic Development. We continue to follow the situation and will update our documentation as information becomes available.

### What the Central Beach Small Area Plan Says

Running parallel to the RFI process, the city conducted a comprehensive planning process for the broader Central Beach area. This plan appears central to understanding why the RFI was canceled.

The Central Beach Small Area Plan covers approximately 80 acres, including the Convention Center, Sports Center, [ViBe Creative District](https://vibecreativedistrict.org/), and the former MOCA building at 2200 Parks Avenue. The planning process began in spring 2024.

On November 21, 2024, the city presented two development concepts to City Council:

| Feature | Central Green Concept | North-South Connections |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------|
| MOCA Building | Preserved and repurposed | Demolished |
| Library | Added to MOCA space | New standalone building |
| Green Space | Enhanced parks | Stormwater park replaces building |
| Art Museum | Repurposed existing | New separate facility |
| Overall Approach | Preserve infrastructure | Build new institutions |

The city's preferred alternative, presented to City Council on April 1, 2025, shows the MOCA building designated to remain. The plan specifically states:

> "The existing MOCA building should be re-purposed, potentially under operational agreement, for cultural and community based programming."

The building is labeled "Community & Culture" under "Existing Improvements to Remain."

**The Apparent Contradiction**

This creates a notable disconnect that we don't fully understand.

The city's Central Beach plan calls for the MOCA building to be repurposed for "cultural and community based programming" under an "operational agreement." This is essentially what the RFI was seeking. It's what we proposed. It's what other applicants presumably proposed.

Yet the RFI was canceled to "explore other options that more closely align with its current vision."

We don't know what explains this. Possible factors could include:

- Preference for direct city control versus lease arrangement
- The phrase "operational agreement" may signal a different arrangement than a lease
- Timing issues between the RFI process and Small Area Plan finalization
- Integration with broader Central Beach development
- Considerations not publicly disclosed

We're documenting facts, not speculating about motives. But the community deserves to understand how a process seeking cultural and community programming could be canceled in favor of a plan calling for cultural and community programming.

## Part 3: Virginia Beach's P3 Experience

### Seven Facilities, Seven Successful Partnerships

The former MOCA building isn't Virginia Beach's only public-private partnership. The city has consistently chosen P3 arrangements over direct government operation for its major cultural and recreational facilities. This institutional experience demonstrates capacity, political comfort, and proven results with the model.

**Virginia Beach Sportsplex**

The city owns the Sportsplex while Hometown Sports Management operates it under a 20-year contract running through 2045. The operator pays the city 5% of gross revenues above $1.1 million annually and must conduct at least 35 events per year at each facility. This structure incentivizes performance while maintaining city ownership. The revenue-sharing model ensures the operator has skin in the game while the city participates in success.

**Atlantic Park**

Atlantic Park represents the city's most ambitious P3 undertaking, a $350 million development with 36% public investment and 64% private investment. The Virginia Beach Development Authority leases land to developers for $1 per year, while complex financing through Community Development Authority bonds and Tourism Investment Program funds enables mixed-use development including entertainment venues, retail, and residential. Live Nation and Oak View Group manage programming under operational agreements.

Atlantic Park demonstrates that Virginia Beach can structure sophisticated multi-party arrangements involving public financing, private capital, and professional operators. The scale and complexity far exceed what a community hub at 2200 Parks Avenue would require.

**Sandler Center for the Performing Arts**

The Sandler Center offers a cultural facility model combining public construction funding with private philanthropic capital and professional management. The Virginia Beach Performing Arts Foundation raised $15 million toward construction, while Oak View Group manages operations. The Sandler Center Foundation contributes approximately $500,000 annually in direct and in-kind support, and 200+ volunteers save the city roughly $500,000 per year in labor costs.

This model shows how philanthropy, public investment, and professional management can combine for cultural facilities specifically.

**Veterans United Home Loans Amphitheater**

The Virginia Beach Development Authority owns the amphitheater while Live Nation operates it under a lease arrangement. This straightforward P3 delivers entertainment programming without requiring city staff to manage concert operations, artist booking, or event logistics.

**Summary: Virginia Beach P3 Facilities**

| Facility | Owner | Operator | Financial Model |
|----------|-------|----------|-----------------|
| MOCA Building (1989-2026) | City | Nonprofit | $1/year lease; city maintains |
| Sportsplex | City | Hometown Sports Mgmt | 5% revenue share above threshold |
| Atlantic Park | VBDA | Venture Realty/Live Nation | 36% public/64% private; TIF bonds |
| Sandler Center | City | Oak View Group | Public/private construction; private operation |
| Amphitheater | VBDA | Live Nation | Lease arrangement |

### What These Examples Prove

Virginia Beach's P3 portfolio demonstrates several important points relevant to 2200 Parks Avenue:

**Institutional Capacity**: The city has structured and managed P3 arrangements across different facility types, financing mechanisms, and operator relationships. The expertise exists.

**Political Comfort**: City Council has repeatedly approved P3 arrangements for major public assets. This isn't a controversial governance model in Virginia Beach.

**Flexibility**: Different facilities use different P3 structures. Revenue sharing, nominal leases, philanthropic partnerships, and complex mixed financing have all worked. The city can tailor arrangements to specific situations.

**Track Record**: These aren't failed experiments. The Sportsplex, Sandler Center, and Amphitheater continue operating successfully under their P3 arrangements.

The question of whether Virginia Beach can structure a successful P3 for a cultural and community facility has already been answered. The city does it regularly. The only question is whether it chooses to apply the same model to 2200 Parks Avenue.

## Part 4: National Evidence

### Community Hubs That Work

Virginia Beach's experience is consistent with national evidence. Across the United States, community innovation hubs structured as public-private partnerships deliver measurable economic impact. The models vary, but the results are remarkably consistent: public investment catalyzes private activity that creates jobs, launches businesses, and generates returns far exceeding the initial outlay.

**1871 Chicago: The Gold Standard**

A $4.8 million state seed investment helped launch this 140,000-square-foot innovation hub in 2012. Today, 850+ alumni startups have raised $3.5 billion in capital and created 14,000+ jobs. The nonprofit Chicagoland Entrepreneurial Center operates the facility with 200+ corporate, university, and accelerator partners.

Programming spans industry-specific incubators for women founders, food technology, real estate tech, and Latino entrepreneurs. UBI Global ranked 1871 the #1 private business incubator in the world in 2019.

The ratio matters: $4.8 million in public investment catalyzed $3.5 billion in private capital raised by member companies. That's a 729:1 multiplier.

**The Ion Houston**

Rice University invested $100 million to renovate a historic 1939 Sears building into a 250,000-square-foot innovation hub. The city contributed a $15.3 million Community Benefits Agreement ensuring equitable outcomes including workforce training and minority business support.

Programming combines coworking, prototyping labs, accelerators across sectors (clean energy, smart cities, aerospace), continuing education, and arts partnerships with Theatre Under The Stars. The facility reached 90% occupancy within three years, proving demand exists for this model in a mid-sized Southern city.

**Chattanooga's Innovation District**

Chattanooga proves mid-sized cities can compete. The Enterprise Center nonprofit anchors a 140-acre district where the city's municipal gigabit internet ("The Gig") serves as infrastructure catalyst. The Edney Innovation Center combines coworking with startup accelerators, digital equity programs, and cultural anchors including the Bessie Smith Cultural Center and public library.

Intentional equity design from the start resulted in 64% women founders and 31% minority founders in accelerator cohorts. Chattanooga shows that community hub success isn't limited to major metros.

**Pittsburgh's Energy Innovation Center**

Pittsburgh Gateways Corporation, a nonprofit, transformed a former trade school into a 160,000-square-foot hub combining university research labs (Pitt, Carnegie Mellon, Duquesne), early-stage business incubators, and construction trades training.

The $37 million development leveraged 28 different funding sources including New Markets Tax Credits. Over 300 individuals have been prepared for construction careers since 2016. Pittsburgh demonstrates that community hubs can integrate workforce development alongside innovation programming.

**mHUB Chicago**

This 80,000-square-foot hardware innovation center demonstrates the power of layered public financing. The project combined $17.55 million in city TIF funding, a $15.52 million tax-exempt bond, $9.4 million in New Markets Tax Credits, and $9.6 million from the state.

Member companies have raised $2 billion+ in capital, launched 1,700+ products, and hired 6,800+ employees. The facility's 11 prototyping labs fill a gap software-focused incubators cannot address, providing physical manufacturing and testing capabilities.

**Brooklyn Navy Yard**

The Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation manages 300 acres of city-owned land, balancing job creation with community outcomes. Newlab operates an 84,000-square-foot innovation hub where member companies have collectively raised $4 billion.

The Employment Center connects residents to opportunities: 70% of hires are Brooklyn residents, and 21% come from public housing. Brooklyn Navy Yard demonstrates that mission-driven nonprofit development can deliver both economic returns and community benefit.

### The Economics Are Compelling

The quantitative evidence for community hub P3s is striking.

**$3.40 Return Per Dollar Invested**

Innovation districts generate $3.40 in economic returns per dollar of public investment according to the Global Institute of Innovation Districts. This multiplier effect compounds through job creation, business formation, tax revenue, and property value increases.

**87% Five-Year Survival Rate**

Incubated businesses dramatically outperform non-incubated startups. National Business Incubation Association data shows 87% five-year survival rates for incubated businesses versus 44% for non-incubated. That's nearly double the survival probability. Mentored startups achieve 70% survival rates while scaling faster than those without support.

**5:1 Job Multiplier**

Brookings Institution research shows each high-tech job creates five additional local service jobs. When innovation hubs create technology employment, the economic benefits cascade through local services, retail, and professional sectors.

**Capital Attraction**

The numbers speak for themselves:

| Facility | Public Investment | Capital Raised by Members |
|----------|------------------|---------------------------|
| 1871 Chicago | $4.8M state funding | $3.5B+ |
| Cambridge Innovation Center | Minimal direct | $17B+ |
| Houston startup ecosystem | Multiple sources | $12B |
| Brooklyn Navy Yard/Newlab | $73M+ city capital | $4B+ |
| mHUB Chicago | ~$52M combined | $2B+ |

### What Makes P3s Succeed

National research and case studies reveal consistent success factors for community hub P3s:

**Nonprofit Operating Structure**

Seven of eight successful national community hubs use nonprofit operating structures. This enables grant funding eligibility, mission focus, diverse revenue streams including philanthropy, and community accountability. For-profit operators can succeed, but nonprofit structures align incentives more naturally with public benefit.

**Layered Financing**

Successful hubs rarely depend on a single funding source. They combine public grants, tax credits, philanthropic contributions, corporate sponsorships, and earned revenue from memberships and programming. This diversification provides resilience and demonstrates broad stakeholder support.

**Community Engagement from the Start**

The World Bank recommends systematic engagement throughout P3 project lifecycles, beginning during feasibility studies. Charlotte held a two-day summit with local and national stakeholders for its rail P3. Rialto's water utility P3 involved a two-year community consultation process. Community input isn't just ethical, it's protective against later backlash.

**Clear Governance with Appropriate Risk Allocation**

Successful P3s use management agreements rather than simple leases when cities want to maintain programmatic involvement. The key difference: leases create landlord-tenant relationships with fixed rent regardless of performance, while management agreements share revenue and risk, keeping the city invested in outcomes.

**Performance Accountability**

Clear metrics across financial, operational, programmatic, and community impact categories enable ongoing evaluation. Quarterly reporting, public dashboards, and defined KPIs keep operators accountable while giving cities visibility into outcomes.

### What Makes P3s Fail

The failure points are equally documented:

**Misaligned Goals**

When public and private partners want fundamentally different things, conflicts emerge that undermine the arrangement. Clear alignment on mission, metrics, and priorities must exist from the outset.

**Overly Optimistic Projections**

P3 financial models must be conservative and stress-tested, not aspirational. When usage or revenue projections are inflated to win a bid, the partnership inevitably suffers when reality falls short of the spreadsheet.

**Hyper-Complex Agreements**

London Underground P3s ultimately cost taxpayers $410 million, partly because the agreements were so complex that oversight became impossible. Simplicity enables accountability.

**Insufficient Competition**

Fewer than three bidders eliminates market discipline. Competition in procurement ensures fair pricing and quality proposals.

**Lack of Transparency**

Chicago's parking meter deal, negotiated "out of public view," generated lasting public backlash. Transparency isn't optional for P3s involving public assets.

## Part 5: A Framework for 2200 Parks Avenue

### What a Successful P3 Would Look Like

Based on the 35-year track record at this location, Virginia Beach's institutional experience, and national best practices, a successful P3 for 2200 Parks Avenue would include these elements:

**501(c)(3) Nonprofit Operator**

The most successful community hubs use nonprofit operating structures. This enables:
- Eligibility for grants and philanthropic funding
- Mission focus rather than profit maximization
- Community accountability through board governance
- Diverse revenue streams including donations

The nonprofit should have a board including cultural organizations, universities (ODU, Regent, Virginia Wesleyan), city representatives, private sector partners, and community members. This diverse governance ensures multiple perspectives and stakeholder investment.

**Management Agreement Rather Than Simple Lease**

A management agreement maintains city involvement in outcomes while delegating day-to-day operations. Unlike a lease, which creates a landlord-tenant relationship with fixed payments regardless of performance, a management agreement typically includes:

- Base management fees of 2-5% of gross revenue
- Incentive fees of 5-15% of gross operating profit
- City approval rights over annual budgets, capital improvements, senior leadership hiring, and major programming changes
- Quarterly reporting on defined KPIs
- Revenue sharing by category (higher operator share for programming to incentivize activation, higher city share for rental and ancillary revenue)

This structure keeps both parties invested in success while providing appropriate oversight.

**Layered Funding Sources**

Following the mHUB Chicago precedent, a 2200 Parks Avenue community hub should layer multiple funding sources:

- Virginia Innovation Partnership Corporation grants
- City TIF or Tourism Investment Program funds
- New Markets Tax Credits (if the census tract qualifies)
- Federal EDA Build to Scale grants
- 3-5 anchor corporate partners
- University partnerships (ODU, Regent, Virginia Wesleyan)
- Philanthropic foundation support
- Membership and program fees for sustainability

No single source should represent more than 25-30% of total funding. Diversification provides resilience.

**Four-Pillar Programming Mix**

The programming should combine elements that reinforce each other:

1. **Technology and Innovation**: Coworking, maker spaces, incubator programs drive economic development and daily activation
2. **Arts and Culture**: Galleries and exhibitions build on the building's heritage while differentiating from purely tech-focused hubs
3. **Culinary Arts**: Demonstration kitchen, culinary incubator, and cafe address Virginia Beach's hospitality sector
4. **Community Events**: Auditorium programming, outdoor events, and community gatherings ensure public benefit and accessibility

This mix creates multiple revenue streams, serves diverse audiences, and activates the space throughout the day and week.

**Clear Performance Metrics**

Success metrics should span four categories:

- **Financial**: Total revenue, operating margins, earned revenue ratio, fundraising progress
- **Operational**: Utilization rates, attendance, maintenance responsiveness, member satisfaction
- **Programmatic**: Diversity of offerings, community access programming, local partnerships, educational outcomes
- **Community Impact**: Jobs created, businesses supported, capital raised by members, demographic diversity of participants

Quarterly reporting on these metrics, with an annual public dashboard, ensures accountability while giving the operator flexibility in how to achieve outcomes.

### Why the Building's Constraints Favor This Model

The property at 2200 Parks Avenue has significant constraints that actually favor a community hub model over alternatives:

The specialized architecture—high-ceilinged galleries, a 300-seat auditorium, and specialized lighting—makes 2200 Parks Avenue ill-suited for traditional commercial conversion like standard retail or medical offices. However, these same "constraints" are assets for a community hub. The open galleries provide the perfect footprint for flexible coworking and art exhibitions, while the auditorium is a turnkey venue for the live events the community requested most. By embracing the building's original design, a P3 model avoids the high costs of structural demolition while maximizing the public utility of the space.

---

## Part 6: What Comes Next

The evidence for a public-private partnership at 2200 Parks Avenue is overwhelming. It is supported by 35 years of local history, the city’s own successful P3 portfolio, and national data proving the economic multiplier of innovation hubs. Most importantly, it is supported by the people of Virginia Beach.

Our community survey wasn't just a data point; it was a mandate. With 86% of respondents expressing positive interest in a mixed-use hub, the public has clearly signaled what they want for this gateway property. They want a space that retains local talent, supports the arts, and serves as a year-round anchor for the resort area.

The building at 2200 Parks Avenue is more than just real estate; it is a piece of Virginia Beach’s cultural infrastructure. While the RFI process has been paused, the need for a sustainable, community-focused model remains. We believe in
