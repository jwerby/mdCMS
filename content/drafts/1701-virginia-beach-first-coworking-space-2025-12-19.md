# The 1701 Story: How We Built Virginia Beach's First Coworking Space

We spent seven years running Virginia Beach's first coworking space. We helped 750 businesses, hosted 300 events, and watched 40+ companies graduate to their own spaces. Then, in June 2023, we closed the doors. This is the story we have never fully told.

1701 was more than a business. It was an experiment in what Virginia Beach could become if someone built the infrastructure entrepreneurs needed. For seven years, we learned what works, what fails, and why community spaces matter more than most people realize.

This is that story: how we started, what we built, why it ended, and what it taught us about building community in a city that deserves better infrastructure for its dreamers and builders.

## Before 1701: What Virginia Beach Was Missing

In 2016, Virginia Beach had no coworking space. That fact seems almost impossible now, when coworking has become standard infrastructure in cities of every size. But when we opened 1701 in the ViBe Creative District, we were told repeatedly it would not work here.

"Virginia Beach is not that kind of city," people said. "People here commute to Norfolk or work from home. There is no demand for shared workspace."

We saw something different.

### The Gap We Recognized

Lisa had spent years in technology and government contracting, watching talented people leave Hampton Roads for opportunities in DC or Richmond. The pattern was consistent: smart, capable people who loved Virginia Beach but could not find the infrastructure to support their ambitions. They needed places to work that were not their kitchen tables. They needed communities of people building things. They needed the informal networks that make entrepreneurship possible.

Jeff had seen the same pattern after his Navy service and time at Amazon. The region had talent. It had veterans with discipline and drive. It had corporate refugees looking for something more meaningful. What it lacked was the connective tissue that turns individual ambition into collective momentum.

### Why We Decided to Build It

The idea for 1701 came from frustration. We had both worked in corporate environments and knew how isolating it could be to build something on your own. Coffee shops were not designed for sustained work. Home offices bred loneliness. The middle ground that entrepreneurs needed did not exist in Virginia Beach.

So we decided to build it ourselves.

The ViBe Creative District was the obvious location. The neighborhood was young and evolving, with galleries, studios, and a creative energy that matched what we wanted to create. The building at 1701 Baltic Avenue had the right bones: open floor plan, natural light, room to grow.

We signed the lease without knowing if anyone would show up.

## Building 1701: The First Year

Opening day was June 2016. The paint was barely dry. The furniture had arrived the week before. We stood at the door wondering if anyone would come.

### The Early Community

They came. Slowly at first, then consistently. Freelancers who had been working from coffee shops. Remote workers for companies in other cities. Solo founders with ideas they were testing. A graphic designer. A marketing consultant. A software developer building her first product.

What struck us immediately was how hungry people were for connection. They did not just want desks. They wanted people who understood what they were doing. They wanted to say "I am building a business" and have someone nod instead of ask when they were going to get a real job.

### What We Got Right

Looking back, we got some things right from the beginning:

**Flexibility over rigidity.** We did not force people into annual contracts or fixed desk assignments. People could use the space in whatever way worked for their stage and style. Some came every day. Some came twice a week. Some showed up only for events. We made room for all of it.

**Community over amenities.** We invested in events, introductions, and programming before we invested in fancy furniture. A mediocre conference room with great people is infinitely more valuable than a beautiful space where nobody talks to each other.

**Presence.** We were there. Every day. We knew members by name. We knew their businesses. We made introductions because we understood who would benefit from knowing whom. This is not scalable advice, but it is honest advice: community spaces need human beings who care, not just good systems.

### What We Got Wrong

We also made mistakes:

**Underestimating operational intensity.** Running a community space is hospitality work. The coffee has to be good every day. The wifi has to work. The bathrooms have to be clean. Someone has to be there when things break, which is constantly. We underestimated how much energy this takes.

**Over-investing in buildout.** We spent money making the space beautiful before we had proven the demand. The demand turned out to be real, but we could have validated it with less financial risk.

**Unclear boundaries.** Early on, we said yes to everything. Every event idea. Every partnership. Every member request. It took time to learn that saying no is part of building something sustainable.

## The Community We Built

Over seven years at 1701 Virginia Beach, something emerged that was larger than the sum of its parts.

### By the Numbers

The metrics tell part of the story:

- **750+ businesses** came through our doors over seven years
- **40+ businesses** grew enough to graduate to their own dedicated office spaces
- **300+ events** brought the community together for learning, networking, and celebration
- **7 years** of continuous operation in the heart of the ViBe Creative District

These numbers mattered to us because they proved something: Virginia Beach had entrepreneurial demand. The people who said it would not work here were wrong.

### Beyond the Numbers

But numbers do not capture what 1701 really was.

It was the coffee conversations that turned into partnerships. Two members meeting at the kitchen counter and realizing they could solve each other's biggest problem. Collaborations that started with "what do you do?" and ended with shared clients, shared projects, shared ambitions.

It was the pitch practice sessions before big meetings. Members running through their presentations, getting honest feedback from people who wanted them to succeed. The quality of pitches that came out of 1701 was noticeably better than what founders developed in isolation. Community makes you better.

It was the late nights when someone needed to vent about a difficult client, a failed deal, a pivot that was not working. There was always someone who understood. Entrepreneurship is lonely. Having people around who get it changes everything.

It was the celebrations. The member who landed her first six-figure contract. The team that closed their funding round. The founder who sold his company and immediately started coming to 1701 to build his next thing. We celebrated wins together because wins in community feel different than wins in isolation.

### The ViBe Connection

1701 did not exist in a vacuum. We were part of the [ViBe Creative District](https://vibecreativedistrict.org/), a neighborhood that was itself evolving during our years there.

The district provided context and foot traffic. Members could walk to galleries, grab lunch at local restaurants, get coffee at nearby shops. The creative energy of the neighborhood infused what we were building. We attracted artists and makers alongside tech founders and consultants. The mix was intentional.

ViBe grew during our years there. The district now has 65+ businesses and has generated a $33.9 million increase in gross sales since 2012. We like to think 1701 contributed to that growth, both by bringing entrepreneurs to the neighborhood and by proving that creative, community-oriented businesses could thrive there.

The district is celebrating 10 years in 2025. Looking back, 1701 was part of ViBe's formative period. We grew up together.

## What We Learned: Lessons From Seven Years

Seven years of running a coworking space teaches you things that business books do not cover. Here is what we learned about building community spaces that actually work.

### Community Is Everything

The single most important lesson: community trumps everything else. Better than location. Better than amenities. Better than price.

Research backs this up. According to the Small Business Administration, 82% of coworking members report expanded professional networks. 64% secured new business through coworking relationships. 74% report improved professional reputation. These outcomes do not come from nice furniture. They come from community.

Building community is harder than buying furniture. It requires programming. Events. Introductions. Shared rituals. It requires someone paying attention to who is struggling and who might be able to help. It requires a culture that people want to be part of.

### Start With Why

Coworking spaces fail when they are just real estate plays. They succeed when they have a clear purpose that attracts the right people.

Our purpose was clear: create infrastructure for Virginia Beach entrepreneurs that did not exist elsewhere. That clarity attracted people who cared about the same thing. It created a shared identity that transcended individual businesses.

The spaces that struggle are the ones that try to be everything to everyone. Clarity creates community. Ambiguity creates emptiness.

### Flexibility Is Foundation

Entrepreneurs need different things at different stages. A solo founder working on her first product needs something different than a team of five preparing for their Series A. A freelancer with irregular income needs something different than a remote worker with a steady paycheck.

We offered multiple membership tiers, flexible terms, and willingness to adapt. When someone's business changed, we changed with them. When they needed to scale down, we made it easy. When they needed to scale up, we found ways to accommodate.

Rigid models fail. Responsive ones thrive.

### Curation Matters

Who is in the space matters as much as the space itself. We learned to think like curators, not just landlords.

This sometimes meant accepting below-market rates from members who added value in other ways. The nonprofit that drew foot traffic might be worth more than a higher-paying tenant who kept to themselves. The experienced founder who mentored others created value beyond their membership fee.

We also learned when to say no. Not every potential member was a good fit. Protecting the community sometimes meant turning down revenue.

### The Hard Parts

Running a community space is harder than it looks. The operational intensity never lets up. Someone has to care about the wifi, the coffee, the cleanliness, the events, the introductions, the culture. Every day.

The economics are challenging. Community spaces require significant upfront investment before revenue materializes. Margins are thin. The most valuable thing you create, community, is the hardest thing to monetize.

And there is real estate dependency. We learned this lesson the hard way.

## The Closing: June 2023

After seven successful years, 1701 closed in June 2023. Understanding why matters because it shaped everything we did next.

### What Happened

The closure was not about business failure. 1701 was not losing money or losing members. The community was strong.

What happened was simpler and more frustrating: we could not reach agreement with the building's landlord on lease renewal terms. After months of negotiation, we reached an impasse. The landlord had different plans for the space. We could not find a path forward that worked for both parties.

So we made the difficult decision to close.

### What It Taught Us

The experience crystallized something we had always known but had not fully confronted: community spaces built on leased property are inherently vulnerable.

No matter how strong the community. No matter how successful the business. If you do not control the real estate, you are one negotiation away from starting over.

This realization shaped everything about how we approached Arrival. When we saw the opportunity to [propose a community hub for 2200 Parks Avenue](https://arrivalvb.com/proposal), the former MOCA building owned by the City of Virginia Beach, the appeal was not just the building's size or location. It was the possibility of building something on more stable ground, with a long-term lease that could provide the security 1701 never had.

### Saying Goodbye

Closing 1701 meant saying goodbye to a community we had spent seven years building. That was the hardest part.

We held a final event. People came who had been members from the beginning. People came who had graduated years earlier but still considered 1701 home. There were toasts and stories and more than a few tears.

What surprised us was how the community responded. Rather than dispersing, people found ways to stay connected. The relationships we had facilitated continued without us facilitating them. The network we had built had become self-sustaining.

That was, in the end, the best outcome we could have hoped for. 1701 created something that outlasted 1701.

## The Legacy: What 1701 Meant

Two years after closing, the impact of 1701 continues to ripple through Virginia Beach's entrepreneurial ecosystem.

### For Virginia Beach

1701 proved something important: Virginia Beach has entrepreneurial demand. The people who said coworking would not work here were wrong. 750+ businesses proved them wrong.

We established a model that others have built upon. The coworking landscape in Hampton Roads is more developed now than it was in 2016. We would like to think we helped prove the market.

More importantly, we contributed to a shift in how Virginia Beach sees itself. The city is not just a beach town. It has entrepreneurs, innovators, and builders who deserve infrastructure that supports their ambitions.

### For the Businesses We Served

The 40+ businesses that graduated to their own spaces are still growing. The connections made at 1701 are still creating opportunities. We still hear from entrepreneurs who got their start at our tables, who met their business partner in our kitchen, who practiced their pitch in our conference room.

That is the real metric of success: did the community we built create lasting value? The answer is yes.

### For Us

Everything we learned at 1701 shaped what came next.

When the City of Virginia Beach released an RFI for the [former MOCA building at 2200 Parks Avenue](https://arrivalvb.com/2200-parks-avenue-virginia-beach-moca/), we saw the opportunity to apply seven years of lessons at a larger scale. The Arrival proposal was not theoretical. It was built on real experience, real relationships, and real understanding of what community spaces need to succeed.

The [community survey](https://arrivalvb.com/community/survey) we conducted showed 86% support for the concept. That response was not surprising to us. We had spent seven years learning what Virginia Beach entrepreneurs want. We knew the demand was real because we had served it for nearly a decade.

## What Comes Next

The story of 1701 is closed, but the story of what we are building is not.

We still believe Virginia Beach deserves better infrastructure for innovation and creativity. We still have the experience, relationships, and vision to build it. We are still looking for the right opportunity to bring what we learned to a larger scale.

The Arrival proposal for 2200 Parks Avenue represented one path forward. The RFI was canceled before a decision was made, but the community need still exists. The building still stands. The playbook we developed still applies.

Virginia Beach has incredible talent. Too often, that talent leaves for cities with better infrastructure. We want to be part of changing that equation, giving entrepreneurs, artists, and innovators reasons to stay and build here.

If you share that vision, we would love to hear from you. The connections that start conversations often turn into partnerships that change outcomes. That was true at 1701. It remains true now.
