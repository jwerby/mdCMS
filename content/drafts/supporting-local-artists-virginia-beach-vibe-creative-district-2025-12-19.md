# Supporting Local Artists in Virginia Beach: What They Need to Thrive

Virginia Beach has artists. Painters, sculptors, ceramicists, photographers, designers, and makers of all kinds live and work here. They are part of what makes this city interesting.

But having artists and supporting artists are different things. Artists need infrastructure to thrive: places to work, venues to show, markets to sell, and community to sustain them. Virginia Beach has some of this infrastructure. It needs more.

During our years operating [1701](https://arrivalvb.com/1701) in the ViBe Creative District and our continued presence there through Fathom Coffee, we have worked alongside artists. We have seen what they need and what they lack. We have watched talented people struggle with infrastructure gaps that other cities have addressed.

This article examines what supporting local artists actually requires and what Virginia Beach could do to become a place where artists thrive.

## Why Supporting Artists Matters

Before discussing what artists need, let us establish why supporting them matters.

### Economic Contribution

The arts are an economic engine, not just a cultural amenity.

According to Americans for the Arts, the nonprofit arts and culture sector generates $151.7 billion in economic activity annually and supports 4.6 million jobs nationally. These are real economic contributions that flow to regions that invest in creative infrastructure.

Locally, the [ViBe Creative District](https://vibecreativedistrict.org/) has generated $33.9 million in increased gross sales since 2012. The creative economy creates jobs, attracts visitors, and generates tax revenue.

Supporting artists is not charity. It is economic development.

### Place Quality

Artists make places interesting.

Cities with vibrant arts scenes attract visitors, residents, and businesses. People want to live in places with galleries, studios, and creative energy. They will pay premium prices for neighborhoods with artistic character.

The ViBe Creative District demonstrates this locally. Property values have increased $56 million as the district has developed. Creative activity attracted investment and appreciation.

### Community Identity

Art expresses community identity.

Public art, local galleries, and creative businesses tell stories about who a community is and what it values. Virginia Beach's identity includes its arts community. Supporting that community reinforces positive identity.

### Talent Retention

Artists who cannot make a living leave.

Without infrastructure to support their work, talented artists relocate to cities with better conditions. Virginia Beach loses their creativity, their economic contribution, and their participation in community life.

Retaining artists requires making Virginia Beach a place where artistic careers are viable.

## What Local Artists Need

Supporting artists requires understanding what they actually need.

### Affordable Studio Space

The most basic need is space to work.

Artists need studios: places with room to create, store materials, and develop work. Studio space must be affordable on artist incomes, which are typically modest. It must have appropriate utilities (lighting, ventilation, plumbing for certain media). It must allow the mess and noise that creative work generates.

Virginia Beach has limited affordable studio space. What exists is concentrated in the ViBe District and a few other locations. As property values increase, even that space faces pressure.

Artists who cannot find affordable studios work in cramped home setups or leave for cities with better options.

### Exhibition and Sales Venues

Creating art is only part of an artistic practice. Artists also need to show and sell their work.

**Galleries.** Traditional gallery spaces host exhibitions, represent artists, and facilitate sales. Virginia Beach has galleries but could support more, especially spaces that show emerging and mid-career artists.

**Alternative venues.** Pop-up exhibitions, restaurant walls, office lobbies, and other non-traditional spaces can extend exhibition opportunities beyond dedicated galleries.

**Markets and fairs.** Art markets, craft fairs, and makers' markets provide direct sales opportunities. First Friday events in the ViBe serve this function monthly. More frequent and larger markets could expand access.

**Online platforms.** Digital galleries and e-commerce expand reach beyond local buyers. But local artists need support navigating these platforms effectively.

### Community and Connection

Artists need each other.

Artistic practice is often solitary, but artists benefit from community. They learn from peers. They find collaboration opportunities. They support each other through creative struggles. They build networks that create opportunities.

Formal programs like artist collectives, critique groups, and professional development workshops build community. Informal gathering in shared spaces does too. Artists need both.

### Professional Development

Artistic skill does not automatically translate to artistic career.

Artists need business skills: pricing work, marketing, managing finances, negotiating contracts, building collector relationships. Many art programs focus on creative development without addressing career sustainability.

Professional development programming helps artists build viable practices. Workshops, mentorship, and resources address the business side of art careers.

### Recognition and Exposure

Artists need people to know their work exists.

Marketing and promotion require resources that individual artists often lack. Collective promotion through district marketing, arts organization communications, and media coverage extends reach.

Public art programs give artists visible platforms. Commissions and installations put work where people encounter it without visiting galleries.

### Financial Support

Creating art requires resources.

Grants, fellowships, and awards provide capital for projects, materials, and living expenses. Virginia Beach artists have access to some funding through state and regional programs, but local support is limited.

Affordable health insurance, retirement planning, and other benefits challenge self-employed artists. Some communities have developed programs to address these needs.

## What Virginia Beach Gets Right

Virginia Beach has infrastructure that supports artists, even if it is incomplete.

### The ViBe Creative District

The [ViBe Creative District](https://arrivalvb.com/blog/vibe-creative-district-virginia-beach) is the anchor of Virginia Beach's arts infrastructure.

The district provides concentrated creative community. Galleries, studios, and creative businesses cluster in a walkable area. First Friday events bring foot traffic and sales opportunities. The district organization advocates for artists' interests.

Lisa serves on the ViBe Creative District Board. We see firsthand the work required to maintain and grow the district. The ViBe is not perfect, but it is real infrastructure that supports artists.

### Art Programs and Education

Virginia Beach has art education and programming.

The Virginia Museum of Contemporary Art (while no longer at 2200 Parks Avenue) continues operations at a different location. The Virginia Beach Art Center offers classes and exhibitions. School and community programs introduce art to residents.

These programs build the pipeline of artists and audience that sustains the local art ecosystem.

### Community Events

Events activate the arts community.

Beyond First Fridays, Virginia Beach hosts Neptune Festival, various fairs and markets, and other events that feature local artists. These events provide exposure and sales opportunities.

### Collector Base

Virginia Beach has residents with resources to collect art.

The local market can support artists if infrastructure connects them with buyers. Collectors exist; artists need channels to reach them.

## What Virginia Beach Needs to Improve

Gaps remain in Virginia Beach's artist infrastructure.

### More Affordable Space

The most critical gap is affordable studio space.

Rising property values squeeze artists out of spaces they once could afford. The ViBe District faces this pressure. Artists need protected affordable space that will not be lost to market forces.

Some cities create dedicated artist studio buildings with below-market rents. Others require affordable artist space as part of development projects. Virginia Beach has not systematically addressed this need.

### Larger Exhibition Venues

Virginia Beach lacks mid-size exhibition venues.

Small galleries exist. Large convention spaces exist. The middle is missing: venues that can host significant exhibitions, installations, or art events too large for typical galleries but not requiring convention center scale.

The former MOCA building could have served this function. [Our proposal](https://arrivalvb.com/proposal) included gallery and exhibition space as core components. The [community survey](https://arrivalvb.com/community/survey) showed 56% interest in art galleries, demonstrating demand.

### Structured Professional Development

Artists need more support building sustainable practices.

Mentorship programs, business skills workshops, and career development resources would help artists translate creative talent into viable careers. These programs exist in some form but could be expanded and formalized.

### Marketing and Promotion

Collective marketing would amplify individual artist efforts.

Virginia Beach Arts (the general concept, not a specific organization) lacks the coordinated marketing that would raise awareness of the local scene. Individual artists and venues market themselves; collective promotion is limited.

### Year-Round Programming

The arts calendar could be fuller.

Events concentrate at certain times, leaving gaps in the calendar. More consistent programming would maintain momentum and give artists regular opportunities.

## What Our Proposal Would Have Provided

The Arrival concept for 2200 Parks Avenue was designed specifically to address artist infrastructure gaps.

### Gallery and Exhibition Space

The former museum building would have maintained exhibition capability.

We proposed gallery spaces for rotating exhibitions featuring local and regional artists. The building's identity as a cultural venue would continue, but with programming that serves the local arts community directly.

### Studio Space

We proposed studio space for working artists.

Artists would have affordable space to create, teach, and collaborate. The studio component would provide the workspace that artists struggle to find.

### Art Classes and Workshops

Educational programming would serve artists and community.

Classes in various media would generate revenue while building skills and engagement. Workshops would address both creative and professional development needs.

### Sales Opportunities

The proposal included multiple sales channels for artists.

Gallery sales, a retail shop featuring local makers, and event-based markets would give artists paths to income. The coworking and event components would bring potential buyers into contact with art.

### Community Hub

Perhaps most importantly, Arrival would have created a gathering place for the creative community.

Artists, entrepreneurs, and community members would share space. Collisions would happen. Collaboration would emerge. The isolation that undermines many artistic practices would be reduced.

## What Anyone Can Do

Supporting local artists does not require building new venues or launching programs. Individual actions matter.

### Buy Local Art

The most direct support is purchase.

Buying work from local artists puts money in their pockets. Collecting local art supports artistic careers directly. Even small purchases matter.

### Attend Events

Show up.

First Friday events, gallery openings, art fairs, and performances need audiences. Attendance validates artistic work and creates the energy that sustains creative communities.

### Commission Work

Custom commissions provide income and creative opportunity.

If you need art for your home, office, or project, consider commissioning local artists rather than buying mass-produced alternatives.

### Advocate

Speak up for arts infrastructure.

When city decisions affect arts funding, zoning for creative uses, or cultural programming, advocate for artists' interests. Attend meetings. Contact representatives. Make the case for creative investment.

### Hire Artists

Businesses can engage artists for services.

Graphic design, photography, illustration, interior styling, and other creative services can be sourced locally. Hiring local artists keeps money in the community.

### Share and Promote

Help artists reach audiences.

Share local art on social media. Tell friends about galleries and events. Write reviews. Recommendation extends reach beyond what artists can achieve alone.

## A Vision for the Future

Virginia Beach could become known as a place where artists thrive.

Imagine:
- Abundant affordable studio space protected from market displacement
- Gallery and exhibition venues of various sizes serving different needs
- Regular markets and fairs providing sales opportunities
- Professional development programs building sustainable artistic careers
- Coordinated marketing raising awareness of the local arts scene
- Year-round programming keeping the creative calendar full
- A community hub where artists, entrepreneurs, and residents gather

This vision is achievable. Other cities have built this infrastructure. The investment required is modest relative to the economic and quality-of-life returns.

## Conclusion: Investment That Pays Off

Supporting local artists is not just the right thing to do. It is smart economic development and community building.

Artists create economic value through direct sales, visitor attraction, and place quality improvements. They contribute to community identity and quality of life. They give Virginia Beach character that generic development cannot provide.

What artists need is infrastructure: space to work, venues to show, markets to sell, and community to sustain them. Virginia Beach has some of this infrastructure, particularly in the ViBe Creative District. The city needs more.

We remain committed to building infrastructure that serves artists alongside entrepreneurs and community members. Our years in the ViBe taught us what artists need. The Arrival proposal was designed to address those needs. Even without that specific project, we continue advocating for creative infrastructure.

Virginia Beach has artists. The question is whether the city will provide what they need to thrive here rather than leaving for places that do.
