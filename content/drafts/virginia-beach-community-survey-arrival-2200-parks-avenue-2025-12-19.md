# What Virginia Beach Wants: Community Survey Results for Arrival

We did not guess what Virginia Beach wanted. We asked.

When we developed [our proposal for 2200 Parks Avenue](https://arrivalvb.com/proposal), the former MOCA building, we conducted a community survey. We wanted to understand what services and programming would serve Virginia Beach residents, entrepreneurs, artists, and visitors.

The response was clear: 86% of respondents expressed positive interest in the Arrival concept. Only 1% said they would be unlikely to use it.

This article shares the full survey results. What the community wants. What they would use. What gaps they see in Virginia Beach's current offerings. These findings shaped our proposal and remain relevant to anyone thinking about community infrastructure in Virginia Beach.

## Survey Methodology

Before diving into results, here is how we conducted the survey.

### Collection Period

The survey ran for 15 days in late 2024. We promoted it through our networks, social media, and community partners.

### Sample Size

Over 100 responses were collected. For a targeted community survey (not a scientific poll), this provided substantial signal about community preferences.

### Respondent Profile

We asked respondents to identify themselves. The sample included:

- **Virginia Beach residents:** Approximately 75 respondents
- **Entrepreneurs:** Approximately 52 respondents
- **Remote workers:** Approximately 40 respondents
- **Local artists:** Approximately 27 respondents
- **Educators:** Approximately 18 respondents
- **Students:** Approximately 3 respondents
- **Visitors:** Approximately 3 respondents

Note that respondents could select multiple categories, so these numbers reflect overlapping identities.

The sample skewed toward the audiences we most wanted to serve: local residents, entrepreneurs, and creative professionals. This was intentional. We wanted to understand what the core user community would want.

## The Top-Line Finding: 86% Positive Interest

The most important finding: 86.1% of respondents said they were "Very Likely" or "Somewhat Likely" to visit or use a community hub like Arrival.

Only 1% said "Unlikely."

This level of interest validated our core hypothesis: Virginia Beach wants this kind of community infrastructure. The demand exists.

### What This Tells Us

The 86% positive response is remarkable for several reasons.

**Broad appeal.** The concept resonated across different audience segments: entrepreneurs, artists, remote workers, families. A community hub that combines multiple functions attracts multiple constituencies.

**Strong interest, not lukewarm.** The majority of positive responses were "Very Likely," not just "Somewhat Likely." People were enthusiastic, not merely open.

**Minimal opposition.** Only 1% said they would be unlikely to use such a facility. Opposition was virtually nonexistent.

This was not a push poll designed to generate positive responses. We asked honestly what people wanted and whether they would use what we proposed. The response was genuinely strong.

## What Services People Want Most

We asked respondents to indicate which services and programming they would be most likely to use. The results prioritized clearly.

### Top 10 Most-Wanted Services

1. **Live Events (concerts, performances, screenings):** 68.3%
2. **Coworking Space:** 66.3%
3. **Outdoor Events (farmers markets, festivals):** 57%
4. **Art Galleries and Exhibitions:** 56.4%
5. **Culinary/Food Programming:** 55%
6. **Art Workshops and Classes:** 50%
7. **Wellness Programming:** 49%
8. **Business Incubator/Startup Support:** 45%
9. **Meeting Rooms:** 44%
10. **Event Rentals:** 42%

### What This Tells Us

The data reveals clear priorities.

**Events dominate.** The top three responses all relate to events: live performances, outdoor events, and by extension, the gathering spaces that make events possible. Virginia Beach wants places to come together.

**Coworking has strong demand.** At 66.3%, coworking was the second-highest response. This confirms what we learned at [1701](https://arrivalvb.com/1701): Virginia Beach has substantial demand for community workspace.

**Arts matter.** Art galleries (56.4%) and art workshops (50%) both scored highly. Virginia Beach residents want creative programming and exhibition space.

**Culinary appeals broadly.** At 55%, food programming ranked fifth. The intersection of food, community, and creative culture resonates.

**Practical needs exist.** Meeting rooms (44%) and event rentals (42%) scored meaningfully. Beyond programming, people need functional spaces for their own activities.

## How Results Shaped Our Proposal

Survey results directly influenced [the Arrival proposal](https://arrivalvb.com/proposal).

### Space Allocation

We allocated space based on what people said they wanted:

**Auditorium (300 seats):** Live events ranked #1. The existing auditorium at 2200 Parks Avenue could host concerts, film screenings, performances, and lectures that the community wants.

**Coworking throughout:** Coworking ranked #2. We planned substantial coworking space in the atrium, gallery areas, and dedicated office wing.

**Gallery and exhibition space:** Art galleries ranked #4. We proposed maintaining exhibition space in the former gallery areas.

**Culinary incubator and cafe:** Culinary programming ranked #5. We proposed expanding the existing kitchen into a culinary incubator with a public cafe component.

**Wellness studio:** Wellness ranked #7. The Rodriguez Pavilion space could flex for yoga, fitness, and wellness programming.

**Outdoor programming:** Outdoor events ranked #3. The 9.6-acre grounds would host farmers markets, festivals, and community gatherings.

### Revenue Model

Survey results also informed our revenue projections.

We projected highest revenue from events and coworking because those are what people said they most want. The [financial model](https://arrivalvb.com/proposal/financials) was built on community demand, not wishful thinking.

## What Gaps the Survey Revealed

The survey also revealed gaps in Virginia Beach's current offerings.

### Lack of Gathering Spaces

The strong response to events (68.3% for live events, 57% for outdoor events) suggests Virginia Beach lacks adequate gathering spaces.

People want to come together for performances, markets, and community events. The demand exists but the supply of appropriate venues does not match it.

### Limited Coworking Options

The 66.3% interest in coworking reflects unmet demand.

Since [1701 closed in 2023](https://arrivalvb.com/1701), Virginia Beach's coworking options have been limited. The survey confirmed that demand persists. Remote workers, entrepreneurs, and professionals want community workspace.

### Art Infrastructure Deficit

The interest in galleries (56.4%) and art workshops (50%) points to infrastructure gaps for the creative community.

Virginia Beach has artists. What it lacks is sufficient studio space, exhibition venues, and educational programming to serve them. The creative community wants more than currently exists.

### Food Innovation Space

The 55% interest in culinary programming suggests opportunity.

Commercial kitchen space for food entrepreneurs is limited. A culinary incubator would serve food innovators who currently lack infrastructure to develop and launch concepts.

## Audience Segment Analysis

Different audience segments showed somewhat different priorities.

### Entrepreneurs

Respondents who identified as entrepreneurs showed particularly strong interest in:
- Coworking space
- Business incubator/startup support
- Meeting rooms
- Networking events

This segment values community workspace and business development support. They need infrastructure to build their companies.

### Artists

Respondents who identified as local artists prioritized:
- Art galleries and exhibitions
- Art workshops and classes
- Studio space
- Event spaces for shows and openings

The creative community wants places to work, show, and sell their art. Exhibition and studio infrastructure matter most.

### Remote Workers

Remote workers emphasized:
- Coworking space
- Fast wifi
- Coffee/food options
- Quiet work areas

This segment needs productive work environment outside their homes. Practical amenities matter as much as programming.

### Families and General Community

Respondents without specific professional categories showed interest in:
- Events and performances
- Art workshops and classes
- Outdoor events and markets
- Community gathering

This segment values programming they can participate in. Events and educational opportunities appeal most.

## What the Survey Did Not Show

Survey results have limitations worth acknowledging.

### Self-Selected Sample

Respondents chose to take the survey. People who already cared about community spaces were more likely to respond than random residents.

This means the 86% positive rate may be higher than the general population would show. However, for our purposes, understanding our potential user community mattered more than polling the general public.

### Interest vs. Behavior

Saying you would use something differs from actually using it.

Survey responses indicate interest, not guaranteed behavior. Some who said "Very Likely" might never actually visit. Some who did not respond might become regular users.

We discounted survey responses in our financial projections to account for this gap between stated interest and actual behavior.

### Specific vs. General

The survey asked about general concept interest, not specific programming choices.

People said they want "live events" but did not specify what types. They want "coworking" but did not detail desired amenities. Implementation requires translating general interest into specific offerings.

## What the Results Mean for Virginia Beach

Beyond our specific proposal, the survey results have broader implications.

### Demonstrated Demand

The 86% positive response demonstrates that Virginia Beach residents want community infrastructure.

This demand is not hypothetical. Over 100 people said they would use a community hub combining coworking, arts, events, and culinary programming. That demand exists regardless of what happens with any specific project.

### Priorities Are Clear

The ranked preferences provide guidance for any community space development.

Events, coworking, and arts consistently ranked highest. These should be central to any community hub concept in Virginia Beach. Facilities that address these priorities will find audience.

### Gaps Need Filling

The survey revealed infrastructure gaps that others could address.

Even if Arrival never happens, Virginia Beach needs more event venues, coworking spaces, and creative infrastructure. The survey documented unmet demand that someone should serve.

## The Full Survey Data

For transparency, the [complete survey results](https://arrivalvb.com/community/survey) are available on our website.

We believe in showing the data that informed our decisions. Anyone interested in community development in Virginia Beach can see exactly what respondents told us.

## What We Learned

Conducting this survey taught us several lessons.

### Ask, Don't Assume

We could have guessed what Virginia Beach wanted. Instead, we asked.

The results largely confirmed our hypotheses but with important nuances. Events ranked higher than we expected. Some services we considered important ranked lower. The data improved our proposal.

### Community Engagement Builds Support

The survey itself built community awareness and engagement.

Respondents who took the survey felt invested in the project. They had contributed input. They watched to see if their preferences would be reflected. Engagement creates stakeholders.

### Data Strengthens Proposals

Having survey data strengthened our proposal to the City.

We could say "86% of respondents want this" rather than "we think people want this." Data provides credibility that assertions lack.

## Conclusion: The Community Spoke

We asked Virginia Beach what it wanted. The community answered clearly.

86% positive interest. Live events as the top priority. Strong demand for coworking. Significant interest in arts and culinary programming. Minimal opposition.

These findings shaped [our proposal for 2200 Parks Avenue](https://arrivalvb.com/proposal). They validated seven years of experience at 1701. They confirmed that the demand we observed directly at our coworking space extends to the broader community.

The RFI process ended without Arrival being selected. The building remains without a long-term plan. But the community demand documented in this survey has not changed.

Virginia Beach wants community infrastructure. The survey proved it. The question is whether that demand will be met.

We remain committed to serving this demand. The concept is ready. The community support is documented. We continue to look for opportunities to bring what the survey showed Virginia Beach wants.

The community spoke. Now someone needs to listen.
