# What's Happening with 2200 Parks Avenue: Virginia Beach's Former MOCA Building

The 38,500-square-foot building at 2200 Parks Avenue has stood at Virginia Beach's gateway to the Oceanfront since 1989. For over three decades, it housed the Virginia Museum of Contemporary Art. Now, as MOCA prepares to open a new facility at Virginia Wesleyan University in early 2026, questions about this property's future have multiplied.

We have a particular perspective on this story. [We submitted a proposal for this building](https://arrivalvb.com/proposal) through the city's formal RFI process. We were invited to interview. And then, along with all other applicants, we received notice that the city had canceled the solicitation entirely.

This article documents what we know about 2200 Parks Avenue, the RFI process, and what questions remain unanswered. We're not here to assign blame or speculate about motives. We're here to provide the most comprehensive resource available on a property that matters to Virginia Beach's future.

## The Property at 2200 Parks Avenue

### Building Details and History

The building at 2200 Parks Avenue was designed by E. Verner Johnson and Associates and completed in 1989. It sits on approximately 9 acres at the western entrance to Virginia Beach's Oceanfront Resort District, adjacent to I-264.

**Key property facts:**
- **Building size**: 38,500 square feet
- **Land**: Approximately 9 acres
- **Year built**: 1989
- **Assessed value**: $7.1 million ($6,026,500 building + $301,300 land)
- **Current lease**: $1 per year to MOCA
- **Annual maintenance cost**: Approximately $209,000 (routine)
- **Deferred maintenance needed**: Approximately $900,000 (windows, doors, roof warranty)

The building includes a 300-seat auditorium, gallery spaces, classrooms, and administrative offices. For 35 years, these spaces hosted exhibitions, educational programs, and community events under MOCA's stewardship.

### Environmental and Zoning Constraints

Anyone proposing to use this property must understand its significant constraints. These aren't insurmountable, but they limit what's possible:

**Environmental constraints:**
- Nearly the entire property falls within a flood hazard zone
- Approximately 3 acres contain wetlands
- 3.5 acres lie within 100 feet of the Chesapeake Bay Resource Protection Area

**Zoning limitations:**
- Current zoning: Preservation (restricts residential, commercial, lodging, and office uses)
- High noise area from Naval Air Station Oceana
- Even if rezoned, residential and assembly uses would remain prohibited due to Oceana noise regulations

These constraints explain why 2200 Parks Avenue has limited options for redevelopment. Cultural and community uses align with what's actually permissible here, making this a natural fit for a Virginia Beach cultural arts venue.

## MOCA's Move to Virginia Wesleyan

### Why MOCA Is Leaving

In July 2023, Virginia MOCA announced plans to relocate to a new purpose-built facility at Virginia Wesleyan University. Groundbreaking for the new facility occurred in August 2024, with an expected opening in early 2026.

The move represents a significant transition for MOCA. The new facility will be designed specifically for contemporary art exhibition and education, without the constraints of the 1989 building. For Virginia Wesleyan, it adds a cultural anchor to their campus.

MOCA's lease at 2200 Parks Avenue officially ended April 30, 2025.

### What This Means for the Building

MOCA's departure from 2200 Parks Avenue created both an opportunity and a challenge for Virginia Beach. The opportunity: a significant public asset becomes available for new purposes. The challenge: finding a use that works within the property's constraints, serves the community, and doesn't burden the city budget.

City Council members have been clear about their expectations. Councilmember Stacy Cummings stated during deliberations: "This is a special piece of property in Virginia Beach. If we try to do anything other than something similar to its current use, we would be run out of town."

The community expects cultural and community use to continue.

## The RFI Process: What Happened

### Timeline of Events

Understanding what happened requires knowing the sequence of events:

**2023**
- July 2023: Virginia MOCA announces relocation to Virginia Wesleyan University

**2024**
- August 2024: Groundbreaking for new MOCA facility
- City receives unsolicited proposals from nonprofit organizations
- City Council discusses property's future

**2025**
- February 2025: City Council agrees to issue formal Request for Information (RFI)
- RFI #ED-25-01 issued for the Lease of 2200 Parks Avenue
- April 1, 2025: Central Beach Small Area Plan preferred alternative presented to City Council
- April 30, 2025: MOCA lease officially ends

- August 22, 2025: Interviews conducted with evaluation committee
- **September 19, 2025: City cancels RFI ED-25-01**

### The Cancellation

On September 19, 2025, the City of Virginia Beach formally canceled RFI ED-25-01. The cancellation letter, signed by Pamela Witham, Senior Planner in Economic Development, stated:

> "After thoughtful review and deliberation, the City of Virginia Beach has decided to cancel this solicitation and explore other options that more closely align with its current vision for the property."

The letter also noted: "This was not an easy decision, as the RFI process attracted a number of strong and compelling submissions."

**What the cancellation means:**
- No applicant was selected
- All proposals were rejected
- The city intends to pursue a different approach
- No public explanation of what that approach will be

### Our Experience with the Process

We submitted [an 85-page proposal](https://arrivalvb.com/proposal) for a community hub concept that would combine coworking, arts programming, culinary innovation, and community events. Our proposal built on [seven years of experience operating 1701](https://arrivalvb.com/1701), Virginia Beach's first coworking space, where we [supported over 750 businesses](https://arrivalvb.com/1701/impact).

In July 2025, we received an invitation to interview. The email from the evaluation committee stated they were "impressed with your proposed use for the space and team assembled."

On August 22, 2025, we presented to the evaluation committee. The 45-minute interview included a 20-minute presentation and 20-minute Q&A. The cancellation letter later noted that "the panel thoroughly enjoyed your presentation and the engaging conversation."

We share this not to argue we should have been selected, but to document that the process proceeded through interviews before being canceled entirely. We're making [our full proposal public](https://arrivalvb.com/proposal) so the community can see what was on the table.

## Known Proposals and Interest

### Pre-RFI Unsolicited Proposals

Before the formal RFI was issued, the city received unsolicited interest from several organizations. Based on public reporting:

1. **Naval Museum** - Pitched by the Navy League of the United States
2. **Performing Arts Theater** - An unnamed nonprofit organization
3. **Library use** - Early inquiries mentioned by city staff
4. **Another museum concept** - Interest mentioned but details not public

These preliminary expressions of interest in the Parks Avenue development helped prompt the city to issue a formal RFI process for 2200 Parks Avenue.

### Formal RFI Submissions

The RFI deadline was June 9, 2025. Based on the cancellation letter's reference to "a number of strong and compelling submissions" and our knowledge that at least three other organizations were invited to interview, the process attracted meaningful competition.

The identities of other Virginia Beach RFI applicants for 2200 Parks Avenue have not been publicly confirmed.

## The Central Beach Small Area Plan

### Why This Plan Matters

Running parallel to the Virginia Beach RFI for 2200 Parks Avenue, the city conducted a comprehensive planning process for the broader Central Beach area. This plan appears central to understanding why the RFI was canceled.

The Central Beach Small Area Plan covers approximately 80 acres, including the Convention Center, Sports Center, ViBe Creative District, and the former MOCA building at 2200 Parks Avenue. The planning process began in spring 2024.

### Two Concepts Presented

On November 21, 2024, the city presented two development concepts to City Council:

| Feature | Central Green Concept | North-South Connections Concept |
|---------|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| MOCA Building | Preserved and repurposed | Demolished |
| Library | Added to MOCA space | New standalone building |
| Green Space | Enhanced parks | Stormwater park replaces building |
| Art Museum | Repurposed existing | New separate facility |
| Overall Approach | Preserve existing infrastructure | Build new institutions |

**Central Green Concept:**
- Preserves the existing MOCA building at 2200 Parks Avenue
- Adds a library and visitor center to the current MOCA space
- More oriented toward green spaces and parks
- Repurposes existing building for civic functions

**North-South Connections Concept:**
- Would demolish the current MOCA building
- Creates a stormwater park in its place
- Builds a separate new art museum, city library, and Mount Olive Baptist Church
- Emphasis on new institutions rather than repurposing

These represent fundamentally different visions for 2200 Parks Avenue: preserve and repurpose versus demolish and rebuild.

### The Selected Approach

The city's [preferred alternative](https://planning.virginiabeach.gov/comp-plan/strategic-growth-areas/resort/central-beach-small-area-plan), presented to City Council on April 1, 2025, shows the MOCA building designated to remain. The plan specifically states:

> "The existing MOCA building should be re-purposed, potentially under operational agreement, for cultural and community based programming."

The building is labeled "Community & Culture" under "Existing Improvements to Remain."

### The Apparent Contradiction

This creates a notable disconnect that we don't fully understand.

The city's Central Beach plan calls for the MOCA building to be repurposed for "cultural and community based programming" under an "operational agreement." This is essentially what the RFI was seeking. It's what we proposed. It's what other applicants presumably proposed.

Yet the RFI was canceled to "explore other options that more closely align with its current vision."

We don't know what explains this. Possible factors could include:
- Preference for direct city control versus lease arrangement
- The phrase "operational agreement" may signal a different arrangement than a lease
- Timing issues between the RFI process and Small Area Plan finalization
- Integration with broader Central Beach development
- Considerations not publicly disclosed

We're documenting the facts about 2200 Parks Avenue Virginia Beach, not speculating about motives.

## What We Still Don't Know About 2200 Parks Avenue

Several significant questions about 2200 Parks Avenue remain unanswered:

**1. What does "operational agreement" mean?**
The Central Beach plan's language suggests a different arrangement than the lease model the RFI sought. This phrase may be key to understanding the city's intentions.

**2. What happens next?**
No public announcement of next steps has been made since the September 2025 cancellation. No news coverage of the cancellation has been published.

**3. Who were the other applicants?**
The identities of organizations that submitted proposals remain unconfirmed publicly.

**4. Why cancel rather than proceed?**
The RFI sought cultural/community use. The Central Beach plan calls for cultural/community use. What specifically didn't align?

**5. What's the timeline?**
When will the city announce its approach? When might programming resume at the building?

These gaps could potentially be addressed through FOIA requests, monitoring City Council agendas, or direct inquiry to Economic Development.

## Why This Property Matters for Virginia Beach

### Location and Visibility

2200 Parks Avenue sits at one of the most visible locations in Virginia Beach. Every visitor arriving via I-264 passes this property before reaching the Oceanfront. It's the literal gateway to the Resort District.

The 9-acre site offers scale that few properties in the area can match. Combined with the existing 38,500-square-foot building, it represents significant infrastructure for whatever use ultimately occupies it.

### The Need for Cultural Infrastructure

Virginia Beach has real needs that this property could help address. [Our community survey](https://arrivalvb.com/community/survey) showed 86% positive interest in a community hub concept. The top requested services: live events, coworking, outdoor events, art galleries, and culinary programming.

These findings align with what we learned over [seven years operating 1701](https://arrivalvb.com/1701). Virginia Beach has talented entrepreneurs, artists, and creators. What's often missing is the infrastructure to connect them.

The former MOCA building could serve that function. With the right stewardship, 2200 Parks Avenue could become Virginia Beach's premier cultural arts venue. The question is how and under whose leadership that happens.

## Our Perspective on 2200 Parks Avenue

We've been transparent throughout this process. We submitted a detailed proposal. We assembled a [board of community leaders](https://arrivalvb.com/proposal/board). We conducted a community survey. We interviewed with the city. And when the RFI was canceled, we made our materials public.

We're not bitter. We believe in civic processes, even when outcomes disappoint us. We also believe communities deserve transparency about how decisions affecting public property are made.

The former MOCA building represents significant public infrastructure. Its future matters beyond any single proposal, including ours. Virginia Beach deserves a clear understanding of what's planned and why.
