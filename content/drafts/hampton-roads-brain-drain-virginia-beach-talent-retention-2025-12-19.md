# Hampton Roads Brain Drain: Why Talented People Leave and How to Stop It

Every year, talented people leave Hampton Roads. They take their skills, their energy, and their future economic contributions to other regions. They leave Virginia Beach, Norfolk, and surrounding cities for places they believe offer better opportunities.

This is brain drain. It is a slow-motion crisis that undermines the region's economic future.

We saw it firsthand. During [seven years operating 1701](https://arrivalvb.com/1701), Virginia Beach's first coworking space, we watched entrepreneurs and professionals make the difficult decision to leave. People who loved Hampton Roads. People who wanted to stay. People who left because they felt they had no choice.

This article examines why brain drain happens in Hampton Roads, what it costs the region, and what would need to change to reverse it.

## The Brain Drain Pattern

Brain drain is not random. It follows predictable patterns driven by economic forces and personal calculations.

### Who Leaves

Not everyone leaves. Brain drain disproportionately affects certain groups.

**Young professionals.** People in their twenties and thirties, establishing careers and building networks, are most mobile. They have fewer ties to keep them in place and more years to benefit from relocating.

**Highly educated workers.** People with advanced degrees and specialized skills have more options. They can command opportunities that do not exist locally.

**Entrepreneurs.** People building companies need ecosystems: investors, talent, advisors, customers. When those ecosystems are weak locally, entrepreneurs leave for places with stronger support.

**Creative professionals.** Artists, designers, and cultural workers need markets and communities. Limited local opportunities push them toward larger metros.

These are exactly the people Hampton Roads needs most. They are the ones who start companies, drive innovation, and create high-paying jobs. Losing them compounds over time.

### Where They Go

The destinations are predictable.

**Washington DC.** Just three hours away, DC offers federal contracting, tech jobs, startup ecosystems, and urban amenities. Many Hampton Roads professionals know DC from military service or government work.

**Richmond.** Virginia's capital has invested heavily in its innovation economy. The startup scene, coworking options, and urban lifestyle draw people from across the state.

**Raleigh-Durham.** The Research Triangle has become a magnet for talent across the Southeast. Tech jobs and quality of life create a compelling combination.

**Remote-friendly metros.** Some leave for places like Austin, Denver, or Nashville that have built reputations as destinations for ambitious professionals.

### Why They Leave

The reasons form a consistent pattern.

**Career opportunity.** The most common factor. People leave because they see better prospects elsewhere. More jobs in their field. Higher salaries. Faster advancement. Stronger networks.

**Professional ecosystem.** Entrepreneurs and professionals need peers. They need communities of people working on similar problems. They need the informal networks where opportunities emerge. When these ecosystems are weak, people leave for places where they are strong.

**Infrastructure.** People need places to work that are not their apartments. They need gathering places, coworking spaces, innovation hubs. When infrastructure is limited, the daily experience of working becomes harder.

**Perception.** Some people leave because they perceive Hampton Roads as lacking ambition or seriousness about economic development. Perception shapes decisions, even when it does not perfectly match reality.

## The Cost of Brain Drain

Brain drain is not just a social problem. It has concrete economic costs.

### Direct Economic Loss

Every person who leaves takes their economic activity with them.

**Income taxes.** Virginia taxes income. Every professional who moves to another state stops contributing to Virginia's tax base.

**Consumer spending.** People spend money where they live. Restaurants, retailers, and service businesses lose customers when people relocate.

**Housing demand.** Departures reduce demand for housing, affecting property values and construction industry employment.

### Indirect Economic Loss

The indirect costs may be even larger.

**Businesses not started.** Entrepreneurs who leave start their companies elsewhere. Those companies hire employees, generate revenue, and create value somewhere else.

**Jobs not created.** Growing companies create jobs. When they grow elsewhere, those jobs go elsewhere too.

**Networks not formed.** Professional networks create opportunities. Each departure weakens the networks that remain.

**Investment not attracted.** Investors follow talent. Regions with thin talent pools attract less investment capital.

### Compounding Effects

Brain drain compounds over time.

Each departure makes the next departure more likely. As talented people leave, the ecosystem weakens. As the ecosystem weakens, remaining talent has more reason to leave. The cycle accelerates.

Conversely, retention compounds positively. Each person who stays strengthens the ecosystem. Stronger ecosystems give others more reason to stay. The cycle reinforces.

Hampton Roads is somewhere in between. Not in complete freefall, but not in virtuous cycle either. The region needs to shift the balance toward retention.

## What Hampton Roads Is Doing Right

Despite the brain drain challenge, Hampton Roads has real advantages.

### Quality of Life

Hampton Roads offers genuine quality of life.

The beach. The weather. The lower cost of living compared to DC or major metros. The space. The outdoor activities. These are real advantages that money cannot easily replicate elsewhere.

For people who value these things, Hampton Roads is compelling. The beach is not just an amenity; for some people, it is the whole point.

### Military Transition Pipeline

The region has a built-in talent pipeline that most metros would envy.

Thousands of military members separate or retire in Hampton Roads every year. Many have discipline, leadership experience, and technical skills. They know the region. They have connections here.

This pipeline provides a continuous flow of talented people who are already here and have reason to stay. The question is whether the region captures this talent or lets it disperse.

### Educational Institutions

Old Dominion University, Norfolk State University, and other institutions produce graduates every year. Many of these graduates would prefer to stay in Hampton Roads if they could find opportunity.

The region has the raw material for talent retention. The challenge is creating the opportunities and infrastructure that make staying viable.

### Emerging Innovation Ecosystem

Hampton Roads does have an innovation ecosystem, even if it is underdeveloped compared to peer regions.

Programs like 757 Accelerate provide startup support. Organizations like 757 Collective connect professionals. Coworking spaces, while limited, do exist.

The foundation is there. It needs investment and attention, but it is not starting from zero.

## What Would Make People Stay

Reversing brain drain requires understanding what would make people stay.

### Career Opportunity

More than anything else, people need jobs.

Not just any jobs. High-paying jobs in growing industries. Jobs that offer advancement and challenge. Jobs that make staying in Hampton Roads a career-positive choice rather than a career sacrifice.

Creating these jobs requires attracting employers, supporting local company growth, and developing industry clusters. It requires economic development focus over years and decades.

### Professional Community

People need to find their people.

Entrepreneurs need communities of entrepreneurs. Tech workers need tech worker networks. Artists need creative communities. These communities provide support, opportunity, and belonging.

Creating professional community requires infrastructure. Places for people to gather. Events that bring them together. Organizations that facilitate connection.

At 1701, we built this kind of community for seven years. We watched what happened when entrepreneurs found their people. They got better at what they did. They formed partnerships. They supported each other through hard times. They stayed.

### Innovation Infrastructure

We have written extensively about [what Virginia Beach needs in innovation infrastructure](https://arrivalvb.com/blog/what-virginia-beach-needs-innovation-infrastructure). The argument applies across Hampton Roads.

People need coworking spaces. They need incubators and accelerators. They need event venues and gathering places. They need the physical infrastructure that makes working and building possible.

This infrastructure exists in DC. It exists in Richmond. It exists in Raleigh. Hampton Roads needs more of it.

### Perception Shift

Some brain drain is driven by perception. People believe Hampton Roads is not serious about innovation or economic development.

Changing perception requires both substance and communication. The region needs real investments in infrastructure and ecosystem. Then it needs to tell that story effectively.

Marketing alone will not solve brain drain. But real progress without effective communication undervalues what the region offers.

## The 1701 Experience

Our experience at 1701 taught us about brain drain firsthand.

### People We Watched Leave

Over seven years, we watched talented members leave Hampton Roads.

A software developer who built her first product at our tables. She got traction, needed to raise capital, and moved to DC where the investor network was deeper.

A marketing agency founder who grew his business to eight employees. He expanded to Richmond because clients there were more numerous and larger.

A startup team that graduated from 1701 to their own office. Two years later, they relocated to Raleigh for access to talent and ecosystem.

These departures were not failures. The individuals succeeded. But their success happened elsewhere, after being nurtured in Hampton Roads. The region invested in them and then lost the return on that investment.

### People We Watched Stay

We also watched people stay. Understanding why they stayed is as important as understanding why others left.

Some stayed for family. Deep roots and relationships outweighed professional considerations.

Some stayed for lifestyle. The beach and quality of life were non-negotiable.

Some stayed because they built what they needed. They created their own opportunities rather than leaving to find them.

This last group is crucial. The entrepreneurs who stay often do so by building the ecosystem they wished existed. They create companies, jobs, and community. They become the anchors that help others stay.

Hampton Roads needs more of these anchor-builders. And it needs to support them so they can succeed.

## Policy Recommendations

What could Hampton Roads do to reverse brain drain?

### Invest in Infrastructure

Build the coworking spaces, innovation hubs, and creative facilities that professionals need. Public investment can catalyze private development. The infrastructure pays for itself through talent retention.

### Strengthen Transition Programs

Capture more of the military transition pipeline. Create programs specifically designed to connect separating service members with local opportunities. Make staying the path of least resistance.

### Support Startup Ecosystem

Increase funding for accelerators and incubators. Create incentives for local investors to invest locally. Reduce barriers for entrepreneurs starting companies here.

### Market the Region

Tell the story of what Hampton Roads offers. Target young professionals and remote workers who could choose to live anywhere. Make the case for coastal quality of life plus professional opportunity.

### Retain University Graduates

Partner with regional universities to connect students with local employers. Create internship programs. Make staying after graduation the default choice rather than an exception.

### Create Talent Attraction Programs

Follow the model of programs like Tulsa Remote that pay remote workers to relocate. Hampton Roads could attract new talent, not just retain existing talent.

## The Role of Community Builders

Policy matters, but so does grassroots community building.

### What We Did

At 1701, we did not wait for policy solutions. We built what we could.

We created space for entrepreneurs to work and connect. We hosted events that brought the community together. We made introductions. We supported members through challenges. We celebrated their wins.

This work was not scalable. It required personal investment and attention. But it made a difference for the 750+ businesses that came through our doors.

### What Others Can Do

Anyone can contribute to reversing brain drain.

Hire locally when you can. Mentor younger professionals. Show up at networking events. Support local businesses. Make Hampton Roads a place where ambitious people can thrive.

These individual actions aggregate. Each person who contributes to the ecosystem makes it stronger. Stronger ecosystems retain more people.

### Our Continued Commitment

[Our proposal for 2200 Parks Avenue](https://arrivalvb.com/proposal) was designed to address brain drain directly.

A community hub with coworking, arts, events, and culinary programming would give people reasons to stay. It would create the infrastructure professionals need. It would anchor community in a visible, permanent way.

The specific opportunity may have passed, but our commitment to Hampton Roads has not. We continue to look for ways to build the ecosystem that keeps talented people here.

## Conclusion: The Choice Hampton Roads Faces

Brain drain is not inevitable. It is the result of choices, both individual and collective.

Individuals choose to leave because they calculate that leaving offers better prospects. Those calculations are rational given current conditions.

But conditions can change. Hampton Roads can invest in infrastructure, strengthen ecosystems, and create opportunities that change the calculation. It can become a place where staying makes sense, not just for lifestyle reasons but for professional ones.

The alternative is continued brain drain. Watching talented people leave. Seeing economic activity migrate to other regions. Falling further behind metros that are making different choices.

We know what Hampton Roads could be. We spent seven years building community here. We saw what happened when entrepreneurs and professionals found each other. We watched businesses grow and people thrive.

That potential remains. Hampton Roads has real advantages: military talent, educational institutions, quality of life, and position. The question is whether the region will invest in capturing that potential.

We believe it can. And we remain committed to being part of that work.
