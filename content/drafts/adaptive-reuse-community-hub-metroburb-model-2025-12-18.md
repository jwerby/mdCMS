# Adaptive Reuse in 2025: How Former Museums, Factories, and Malls Become Innovation Hubs

Across America, a quiet transformation is reshaping how communities think about their most challenging real estate. Former department stores are becoming food halls. Abandoned factories house artist studios. Shuttered museums are reimagined as adaptive reuse community hubs.

This is not demolition and rebuild. It is adaptive reuse: the practice of repurposing existing buildings for new functions while preserving their bones, their character, and often their place in a community's identity.

The economics are compelling. Adaptive reuse projects typically cost 16% less than new construction. They preserve embodied carbon that would otherwise be released through demolition. They keep buildings that anchor neighborhoods intact rather than leaving vacant lots or generic replacements.

But the real story is not about cost savings or sustainability. It is about what happens when communities choose to reimagine rather than erase. The most successful adaptive reuse projects do not just fill vacant square footage. They become catalysts for economic development, talent attraction, and community pride.

In 2025, this approach has moved from architectural curiosity to mainstream economic development strategy. Cities large and small are looking at underutilized buildings and asking: what could this become?

The answers are more creative than ever. And the results, across a diverse range of building types and community contexts, point toward a set of principles that separate successful transformations from expensive failures.

Here are five projects that got it right, and what they reveal about turning yesterday's buildings into tomorrow's community anchors.

The following five adaptive reuse case studies demonstrate what works and why.

## Bell Works Case Study: The Metroburb Model for Community Hubs

In Holmdel, New Jersey, [Bell Works](https://www.bellworks.com/) sat largely vacant for years after its original tenant departed. The 2-million-square-foot building, designed by Eero Saarinen and once home to Bell Labs where the transistor, laser, and cellular technology were invented, had become a monument to corporate downsizing.

Developer Somerset Development saw something different: not a problem to demolish, but an opportunity to create what they called a "metroburb." The concept was simple but radical. What if a suburban office building could function like a small city?

Today, Bell Works houses over 100 businesses, restaurants, a hotel, fitness facilities, a library branch, and even a public school. The building's iconic atrium has become a year-round town square, hosting farmers markets, concerts, and community events. Daily foot traffic rivals many urban centers.

### What Made It Work

The project succeeded by treating the building as a small city rather than a traditional office complex. Somerset did not just lease space. They curated a mix of tenants that would create reasons for people to visit, linger, and return. A library draws families. Restaurants draw lunch crowds. Event programming draws evening visitors.

The building's architecture helped. Saarinen's design featured an interior "street" that now functions as Main Street would in a traditional town: a public gathering space that belongs to everyone, not just tenants.

Bell Works attracted over $200 million in private investment and helped transform Holmdel from a bedroom community into a regional destination. Property values in the surrounding area increased measurably after the project opened.

The lesson: adaptive reuse works best when it creates something the community needs, not just something the building can accommodate. It is the same principle that guided [1701, Virginia Beach's first coworking space](https://arrivalvb.com/1701), which spent seven years proving that curated community spaces create value that generic real estate cannot.

## Torpedo Factory Art Center: From Munitions to Masterpieces

On the waterfront in Alexandria, Virginia, the [Torpedo Factory Art Center](https://www.torpedofactory.org/) has operated since 1974 as one of the earliest and most influential adaptive reuse projects in the country. The former U.S. Naval Torpedo Station remains a model for how industrial buildings can serve creative communities.

The building manufactured torpedo shell cases and other munitions during World War I and World War II. After the war, it sat vacant for decades before the City of Alexandria purchased it for adaptive reuse.

Today, the Torpedo Factory houses 82 artist studios where painters, sculptors, printmakers, jewelers, and other artists create and sell their work. Visitors can watch artists in their studios, take classes, and purchase original art directly from creators. The center welcomes over half a million visitors annually.

### What Made It Work

The Torpedo Factory succeeded by solving a real problem for a specific community: working artists needed affordable studio space with built-in foot traffic. The building's industrial bones, with high ceilings, open floor plans, and abundant natural light, happened to be ideal for studio use.

But the real innovation was the model. Artists do not just rent space. They commit to being present and working in public view. This creates a living museum experience that draws visitors, which in turn creates sales opportunities for artists. The model is self-reinforcing.

The city's role was also crucial. Public ownership allowed for below-market rents that kept the space accessible to working artists rather than becoming a high-end gallery district.

After 50 years, the Torpedo Factory continues to prove that adaptive reuse can serve communities for generations when the model aligns building, tenants, and community needs.

## Ponce City Market: Sears Warehouse to Urban Destination

In Atlanta, a massive 1920s Sears, Roebuck & Co. distribution center sat underutilized for years after Sears departed. At 2.1 million square feet, it was one of the largest brick structures in the Southeast and far too significant to demolish.

Developer Jamestown transformed the building into [Ponce City Market](https://www.poncecitymarket.com/), a mixed-use destination that opened in 2014. The project includes office space, apartments, a food hall, retail, a rooftop amusement park, and the Central Food Hall featuring local restaurants and artisan food vendors.

The building anchors the Atlanta BeltLine, a 22-mile network of public parks, trails, and transit that has become central to Atlanta's urban identity.

### What Made It Work

Ponce City Market succeeded by embracing mixed-use at massive scale. The building was large enough to accommodate every component of a complete neighborhood: places to work, live, eat, shop, and play. This diversity of uses creates all-day activation and makes the building resilient to changes in any single market.

The food hall concept proved especially powerful. Rather than recruiting national restaurant chains, Ponce City Market invited local chefs and food entrepreneurs to open stalls. This created a destination for food discovery that could not be replicated at a suburban mall.

The BeltLine connection was also essential. By tying the building to Atlanta's most ambitious public infrastructure project, developers ensured that Ponce City Market would benefit from continuous public investment in surrounding neighborhoods.

The project has generated over $300 million in assessed value and catalyzed development along the entire BeltLine corridor.

## The Thread: How a Small City Punched Above Its Weight

Not every adaptive reuse success story requires a million-square-foot building or a major metropolitan area. In Rock Hill, South Carolina (population 75,000), a former textile bleachery has become [The Thread](https://www.thethreadrockhill.com/), a mixed-use development that demonstrates how smaller cities can compete for talent and investment.

The original building manufactured textiles for over a century before closing. Rather than allowing the site to become another abandoned mill, the city partnered with developers to reimagine it as an innovation hub.

Today, The Thread includes coworking space, maker studios, event venues, restaurants, and a brewery. It has become the center of Rock Hill's innovation district, attracting startups and remote workers who might otherwise have located in Charlotte, 25 miles north.

### What Made It Work

The Thread succeeded by recognizing that smaller cities have different competitive dynamics than major metros. Rock Hill cannot match Charlotte's corporate headquarters or nightlife. But it can offer lower costs, shorter commutes, and a sense of community that large cities struggle to provide.

The project leaned into these advantages. Programming at The Thread emphasizes community building and local entrepreneurship rather than corporate amenities. The tenant mix prioritizes locally-owned businesses. Events focus on connecting neighbors rather than attracting tourists.

City government played an active role, providing tax incentives and infrastructure investments that made the project financially viable. This public-private partnership model has become standard for adaptive reuse in smaller markets.

The Thread demonstrates that adaptive reuse is not just for coastal cities or major metros. Any community with a significant building and a vision can create something valuable.

## Industry City: Manufacturing Complex to Innovation Campus

In Brooklyn's Sunset Park neighborhood, [Industry City](https://industrycity.com/) had operated as a manufacturing and shipping hub for most of the 20th century. The 6-million-square-foot industrial complex along the waterfront sat underutilized by the 2000s as New York's manufacturing economy contracted.

Rather than converting the complex to residential use, as happened with many Brooklyn industrial sites, the owners pursued a different vision. Industry City would remain a place of production, but the products would change.

Today, the complex houses over 500 businesses employing 8,000 workers. Tenants include food manufacturers, design studios, tech companies, artists, and makers of all kinds. The site also includes a food hall, event spaces, and retail.

### What Made It Work

Industry City succeeded by updating the definition of "industry" rather than abandoning it. The buildings were designed for making things. They still house people who make things. The things are just different now: software instead of ship parts, artisanal chocolate instead of industrial components.

The project maintained affordability by keeping industrial zoning and offering a range of space types at different price points. A startup can rent a small studio. A manufacturer can lease an entire floor. This flexibility allowed Industry City to grow with its tenants rather than pricing them out.

The scale also created critical mass. With 500 businesses in one location, tenants benefit from proximity to customers, collaborators, and suppliers. A furniture designer can source materials, find fabrication partners, and meet clients without leaving the campus.

Industry City shows that adaptive reuse can preserve a neighborhood's economic character even as the economy evolves.

## What Makes Adaptive Reuse Work: Five Common Patterns

These five adaptive reuse community hub examples span different building types, cities, and scales. But they share common patterns that explain their success.

### 1. They Solve Real Problems for Specific Communities

Every successful project started by identifying an unmet need. Bell Works gave suburban New Jersey a town center it lacked. The Torpedo Factory gave Alexandria artists affordable studio space with foot traffic. Ponce City Market gave Atlanta a food destination tied to its most ambitious public project.

Adaptive reuse fails when developers try to impose a generic concept on a building. It succeeds when they ask: what does this specific community need that this specific building can provide?

### 2. They Embrace Mixed Use

Single-use buildings are vulnerable. An office building with no retail empties out at 5pm. A food hall with no offices struggles for lunch traffic. A residential building with no amenities forces residents to drive everywhere.

The most successful adaptive reuse projects combine multiple uses that reinforce each other. Workers support restaurants. Residents support retail. Events draw visitors who discover tenants. This diversity creates resilience and all-day activation.

### 3. They Curate Rather Than Just Lease

Filling a building with whoever pays rent is easy. Building a community is hard. The best adaptive reuse projects act more like curators than landlords, selecting tenants who will contribute to a larger vision rather than just occupy space.

This often means accepting below-market rents from tenants who add value in other ways. A nonprofit that draws foot traffic may be worth more than a higher-paying tenant who does not. A local business may create more community connection than a national chain.

### 4. They Honor the Building's Character

The most compelling adaptive reuse projects do not fight their buildings. They embrace the quirks, the industrial bones, the history embedded in the walls. Exposed brick and original floors are not liabilities to be covered. They are assets that create authenticity.

This does not mean preservation at all costs. Buildings must be updated for modern uses. But the best projects find ways to honor what came before while serving what comes next.

### 5. They Require Patient Capital and Public Partnership

Adaptive reuse is rarely a quick flip. The complexity of working with existing buildings, the time required to build community, and the need for tenant curation all require investors with longer time horizons than typical real estate development.

Public partnership often makes these projects possible. Tax incentives, infrastructure investments, and zoning flexibility help bridge the gap between what adaptive reuse costs and what conventional development returns.

## What This Means for Communities with Vacant Buildings

Every community has buildings with more history than current use. Former department stores. Closed factories. Museums that have moved on. The question is not whether these buildings can become adaptive reuse community hubs. The evidence proves they can.

The question is whether communities have the vision to see possibility where others see problems, and the patience to build something lasting rather than settling for the fastest path to filling space.

At Arrival, we proposed transforming [2200 Parks Avenue, the former MOCA building in Virginia Beach](https://arrivalvb.com/2200-parks-avenue-virginia-beach-moca/), into an adaptive reuse community hub. The building sits at the gateway to the Oceanfront Resort District on 9.6 acres. It has the bones, the location, and the community support for something remarkable.

Our [proposal](https://arrivalvb.com/proposal) drew directly on the principles that made Bell Works, the Torpedo Factory, and these other projects successful: mixed use, community curation, honoring the building's cultural history, and solving real problems for Virginia Beach's entrepreneurs, artists, and innovators.

The city's RFI process was canceled before a decision was made. But the opportunity remains. The building still stands. The community need still exists. And the proven playbook for adaptive reuse success is clearer than ever.

What could your community's vacant building become?
