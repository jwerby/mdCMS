# Remote Work in Virginia Beach: Why This City Is Perfect for It

Remote work changed everything about where people can live. When your job exists on a laptop, geography becomes a choice rather than a constraint.

Millions of Americans are making that choice right now. They are leaving expensive metros for places that offer better quality of life at lower cost. They are trading cramped apartments for actual space. They are prioritizing lifestyle over proximity to an office they no longer need to visit.

Virginia Beach should be at the top of their list.

We have watched this shift firsthand. At [1701](https://arrivalvb.com/1701), Virginia Beach's first coworking space, remote workers were a growing segment of our membership for seven years. They came for the beach and the quality of life. They stayed because they found community.

This article is for remote workers considering Virginia Beach, for those already here looking to connect, and for anyone interested in why this city is positioned to thrive in the remote work era.

## Why Remote Workers Choose Virginia Beach

Virginia Beach offers a combination that is genuinely rare: coastal lifestyle, affordable cost of living, and a growing professional community.

### The Lifestyle Factor

Let us start with the obvious: Virginia Beach is beautiful.

Thirty-five miles of coastline. The Chesapeake Bay on one side, the Atlantic Ocean on the other. Mild winters that rarely see significant snow. Summers that draw millions of visitors.

For remote workers whose office can be anywhere, lifestyle matters. When you are not tied to a commute, you can optimize for what you actually want in your daily life.

Virginia Beach offers:
- Beach access year-round
- Extensive parks and natural areas
- Water sports from kayaking to surfing
- Outdoor activities in every season
- A restaurant and brewery scene that has grown substantially in recent years

The ViBe Creative District, where we operated 1701 for seven years, exemplifies what makes Virginia Beach special. Walkable streets lined with galleries, studios, and local businesses. Farmers markets and community events. The energy of creativity without big-city prices or hassles.

### The Cost Equation

Here is where Virginia Beach gets interesting for remote workers.

If you are earning a salary benchmarked to DC, New York, or San Francisco but living in Virginia Beach, you gain significant purchasing power. Housing costs are substantially lower. You do not need to spend $3,000 for a one-bedroom apartment. You can actually own a home.

According to cost-of-living comparisons, Virginia Beach typically runs 15-25% below the national average in key categories. Compared to major metros, the savings are even more dramatic.

Remote workers who keep their big-city salary while living Virginia Beach costs are essentially giving themselves a raise.

### The Time Zone Advantage

Virginia Beach sits in the Eastern time zone, which matters for remote work.

For workers on distributed teams, Eastern time maximizes overlap with both coasts. You can take morning calls with Europe and afternoon calls with California. You are never too early or too late for collaboration.

This might seem like a small thing, but remote workers know that time zone alignment affects quality of life. Being in Eastern time means more reasonable hours for most business communication.

## The Challenges Remote Workers Face Here

Honesty requires acknowledging what Virginia Beach does not do well for remote workers.

### Limited Coworking Options

Virginia Beach has fewer coworking spaces than peer cities. After 1701 closed in 2023, options became even more limited.

Remote workers who want to escape their home office have few dedicated options. Coffee shops work for occasional change of scenery but are not designed for sustained professional work. Hotel business centers are expensive and impersonal.

This is a genuine gap. The demand exists, as we proved for seven years at 1701. The supply has not caught up.

### Scattered Professional Community

Virginia Beach has plenty of remote workers, but they are hard to find.

Without dedicated gathering places, the professional community remains fragmented. Remote workers in other cities can join coworking spaces and immediately access a network. In Virginia Beach, building that network requires more effort.

Meetup groups exist. LinkedIn connections happen. But the infrastructure that makes professional networking easy is less developed here than in other cities.

### The "Beach Town" Perception

Some remote workers hesitate because they see Virginia Beach as a vacation destination rather than a serious place to build a career.

This perception is outdated but persistent. Virginia Beach has a substantial professional economy beyond tourism. Major employers include military installations, healthcare systems, and corporate operations. The tech and startup scene, while smaller than Richmond or DC, is growing.

But perception matters. Remote workers considering relocation sometimes overlook Virginia Beach because they assume it lacks professional substance.

## Building Community as a Remote Worker in Virginia Beach

The challenges are real, but they are not insurmountable. Remote workers who commit to Virginia Beach can build meaningful professional community.

### Finding Your People

Start by identifying the communities that already exist.

**Tech meetups and professional groups.** Hampton Roads has active communities in software development, digital marketing, and other fields. Check Meetup.com and LinkedIn for local groups.

**757 networks.** The 757 area code has become a rallying point for local professionals. Organizations like 757 Collective and 757 Angels connect people across Hampton Roads.

**ViBe Creative District.** If you work in creative fields, the ViBe community offers connections. First Friday art walks, studio tours, and gallery openings bring people together.

**Chambers and business associations.** The Hampton Roads Chamber and local business groups host events that can help you build networks.

### Creating Structure

Remote work freedom can become remote work isolation. Structure helps.

**Establish routines.** Decide when and where you work. Consistency creates separation between work and life.

**Schedule social time.** Put coffee meetings and networking events on your calendar like work meetings. Otherwise, they will not happen.

**Find third places.** Identify locations outside your home where you can work or meet people. Even imperfect options are better than never leaving the house.

**Join something.** Sports leagues, volunteer organizations, hobby groups. Community forms around shared activities.

### The Coworking Question

Remote workers in Virginia Beach face a practical question: where do I actually work?

**Home office.** The default option. Works if you have dedicated space and can maintain boundaries. Does not work if your living situation lacks room or you struggle with isolation.

**Coffee shops.** Good for variety, bad for long stretches. Wifi reliability varies. You will feel obligated to keep buying things.

**Libraries.** Free, quiet, and reliable. Limited hours and usually no talking allowed, which eliminates phone calls.

**Hotel lobbies.** Some remote workers use hotel business centers or lobbies. Expensive if you pay for day passes. Awkward if you do not.

The ideal option, dedicated coworking space, remains limited in Virginia Beach. This is precisely why [our proposal for 2200 Parks Avenue](https://arrivalvb.com/proposal) included substantial coworking as a core component. The [community survey](https://arrivalvb.com/community/survey) showed coworking was the second-most-requested service at 66%.

## What Virginia Beach Needs to Attract More Remote Workers

Virginia Beach has natural advantages for remote workers. To fully capitalize on the remote work shift, the city needs infrastructure investments.

### Dedicated Workspace Options

The most obvious need is more coworking space.

Remote workers need places to work that are not their homes. They need fast wifi, comfortable seating, access to meeting rooms, and community. They will pay for it.

At 1701, we proved demand exists. We operated successfully for seven years. The closure was not about lack of demand; it was about real estate circumstances we could not control.

Virginia Beach needs operators willing to serve this market and real estate conditions that make it viable.

### Community Programming

Beyond physical space, remote workers need programming that brings them together.

Networking events, skill-sharing workshops, lunch-and-learns, happy hours. Programming creates excuses for connection that isolated remote workers desperately need.

This programming can happen in various venues. What matters is that someone organizes it and promotes it consistently.

### Marketing the Opportunity

Virginia Beach does not market itself effectively to remote workers.

Other cities have launched campaigns to attract remote workers. Tulsa Remote offers $10,000 grants for remote workers who relocate. Vermont has similar programs. West Virginia's Ascend program targets remote workers explicitly.

Virginia Beach could compete for these workers. Coastal lifestyle, affordability, quality of life: these are genuine selling points. But the city has not made a coordinated effort to tell this story.

## The Future of Remote Work in Virginia Beach

Remote work is not going away. The pandemic accelerated a shift that was already underway, and the new patterns have proven durable.

### The Numbers

According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, remote work remains far more common than before 2020. While some companies have pushed return-to-office policies, hybrid and fully remote arrangements persist across many industries.

FlexJobs research indicates that the majority of workers prefer remote or hybrid options. Companies that demand full-time office presence face challenges in recruitment and retention.

This structural shift creates ongoing opportunity for places like Virginia Beach. Every year, more workers gain the freedom to choose where they live.

### Virginia Beach's Position

Virginia Beach is positioned to benefit from continued remote work growth. The lifestyle advantages are durable. The cost equation remains favorable. The quality of life is genuine.

What Virginia Beach needs is infrastructure to serve the remote workers who come and community to help them stay.

The cities that build this infrastructure will capture disproportionate benefit from the remote work migration. Virginia Beach has the raw materials. The question is whether it will invest in the infrastructure.

### What We Are Doing About It

Our work continues even after 1701's closure.

The Arrival concept we proposed for 2200 Parks Avenue was designed specifically to serve remote workers alongside entrepreneurs, artists, and community members. The coworking component was not an afterthought; it was central to the vision.

We remain committed to building the infrastructure Virginia Beach needs. We are exploring opportunities and having conversations. The need has not diminished; if anything, it has grown.

If you are a remote worker in Virginia Beach looking to connect, or an organization interested in serving this community, we would welcome the conversation.

## Practical Resources for Remote Workers in Virginia Beach

For remote workers already here or considering the move, here are practical resources:

### Workspace Options

- **Libraries:** Wahab Public Law Library, local branches (quiet work only)
- **Hotel business centers:** Check day pass availability at major hotels

### Networking Groups

- **Virginia Beach Young Professionals:** Events and networking
- **Industry-specific meetups:** Check Meetup.com for tech, marketing, creative groups

### Cost of Living Research

- Factor in no state income tax on military retirement
- Compare car insurance rates (Virginia Beach typically competitive)

### Quality of Life Resources

- **Virginia Beach Parks & Recreation:** Extensive program offerings
- **First Landing State Park:** Beach and trails within the city
- **ViBe Creative District:** Cultural programming and community events

## Conclusion: Virginia Beach Is Ready for Remote Work

Remote work liberation means people can live where they want to live. Virginia Beach should be on the shortlist for anyone who values coastal lifestyle, affordable living, and quality of life.

The city has genuine advantages. The beach. The weather. The cost equation. The time zone. The space.

What Virginia Beach needs to fully capture the remote work opportunity is infrastructure: coworking spaces, community programming, coordinated marketing. These are solvable problems.

We spent seven years at 1701 proving that remote workers want community in Virginia Beach. The demand is real. The opportunity is real.

For remote workers considering Virginia Beach: come. The lifestyle delivers on its promise. Yes, you will need to work harder to find community than you would in cities with more developed infrastructure. But the community exists, and it welcomes newcomers.

For Virginia Beach: invest in this opportunity. Remote workers bring income earned elsewhere but spent locally. They start businesses. They volunteer in the community. They choose to be here, which means they are invested in making it better.

The remote work migration is one of the largest population shifts in American history. Virginia Beach can be a destination. The question is whether it will build the infrastructure to capture that potential.
