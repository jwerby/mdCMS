# What Virginia Beach Needs: The Case for Innovation Infrastructure

Virginia Beach has something most cities would envy: talent. Military veterans with discipline and leadership skills. Corporate professionals with enterprise experience. Creative minds drawn to the coastline. Remote workers who chose this city over anywhere else.

What Virginia Beach lacks is the infrastructure to keep them here.

Every year, talented people leave Hampton Roads for cities that offer what Virginia Beach does not: places to work that are not kitchen tables, communities of builders and creators, the informal networks that turn individual ambition into collective momentum. This is not a failure of talent. It is a failure of infrastructure.

After [seven years running 1701](https://arrivalvb.com/1701), Virginia Beach's first coworking space, we saw this pattern repeatedly. Entrepreneurs who loved Virginia Beach but could not find the support systems they needed. Remote workers who craved community but had nowhere to find it. Artists who wanted studio space and found nothing available. The demand exists. The supply does not.

This article makes the case for why innovation infrastructure matters, what it actually looks like, and what Virginia Beach stands to gain by investing in it.

## The Infrastructure Gap: What Virginia Beach Is Missing

Walk through downtown Richmond. Count the coworking spaces. Notice the innovation districts, the startup incubators, the creative hubs where entrepreneurs gather. Now do the same in Virginia Beach.

The difference is stark.

### The Current Landscape

Virginia Beach, with a population exceeding 450,000, has remarkably few dedicated spaces for innovation and entrepreneurship. The coworking options that exist are limited. The startup support infrastructure is scattered. The creative spaces are underfunded or nonexistent.

This is not because Virginia Beach lacks entrepreneurs. During our years at 1701, we helped 750+ businesses. We watched 40+ companies grow enough to graduate to their own dedicated office spaces. The demand was consistent and growing.

The problem is structural. Virginia Beach developed primarily as a resort and residential community. The infrastructure that supports innovation in other cities, the coworking spaces and incubators and creative hubs, never got built here in the same way.

### Why This Matters for Economic Development

According to the Brookings Institution, cities that invest in innovation infrastructure see measurably better economic outcomes. They retain more talent. They attract more startups. They generate more high-paying jobs.

The Small Business Administration reports that 82% of coworking members expand their professional networks through their workspace community. 64% secure new business through coworking relationships. 74% report improved professional reputation.

These are not soft benefits. They translate directly into economic activity: new companies formed, jobs created, tax revenue generated.

Virginia Beach is leaving this economic potential on the table.

## What Innovation Infrastructure Actually Looks Like

When we talk about innovation infrastructure, what do we mean? It is more than office space with good wifi. True innovation infrastructure creates the conditions for entrepreneurship and creativity to flourish.

### Community Workspaces

The foundation of innovation infrastructure is space where people can work alongside others who are building things.

This is not about desks. It is about collisions.

At 1701, we watched partnerships form at the coffee machine. We saw freelancers become cofounders after months of working at adjacent tables. We witnessed businesses find their first customers through introductions made by other members.

These collisions do not happen in home offices. They do not happen in coffee shops where people wear headphones and avoid eye contact. They happen in spaces designed to facilitate connection.

Effective community workspaces include:
- Flexible membership options for different stages and needs
- Common areas that encourage interaction
- Private spaces for focused work and confidential calls
- Event programming that brings people together
- Community managers who facilitate introductions

### Creative and Maker Spaces

Innovation is not limited to tech startups. Artists, craftspeople, and makers need infrastructure too.

Studio space is expensive and hard to find. Equipment like kilns, printing presses, and woodworking tools are prohibitively costly for individuals. Gallery space for exhibition and sales is scarce.

Creative infrastructure includes:
- Affordable studio space with flexible terms
- Shared equipment and maker facilities
- Gallery and exhibition space
- Classrooms and workshop areas
- Retail opportunities for local makers

Virginia Beach has a vibrant arts community, particularly in the [ViBe Creative District](https://vibecreativedistrict.org/). But the infrastructure to support that community remains limited. Artists work out of cramped home studios or leave for cities with better facilities.

### Event and Gathering Venues

Innovation does not happen in isolation. It happens when people come together for learning, networking, celebration, and exchange.

Cities with strong innovation ecosystems have venues where the community gathers. Pitch nights where founders present to potential investors. Conferences that bring together industry experts. Meetups where people with shared interests connect. Lectures and workshops that spread knowledge.

Virginia Beach has few venues designed for this kind of programming. Hotel conference rooms are expensive and sterile. Restaurant back rooms are too small. The gap between "coffee shop meetup" and "convention center conference" has few options in between.

### Incubation and Acceleration Programs

Some entrepreneurs need more than space. They need structured support: mentorship, curriculum, connections to capital, guidance through the early stages of building a company.

Incubators and accelerators provide this scaffolding. They take raw entrepreneurial energy and channel it into viable businesses. They connect founders with advisors who have done it before. They create cohorts where founders support each other.

Hampton Roads has some programs, but they are underfunded and under-resourced compared to peer regions. The 757 Accelerate program, which Lisa serves on the board of, does excellent work but operates with limited capacity.

## The Brain Drain Problem

Here is what happens without innovation infrastructure: talented people leave.

### The Pattern We Saw

At 1701, we watched it happen repeatedly. A founder builds something promising. They start getting traction. They need to raise capital, hire a team, scale their operations. They look around Virginia Beach and ask: where are the investors? Where is the talent pool? Where is the ecosystem that will support my growth?

Too often, the answer is: not here.

So they move. To DC. To Richmond. To Raleigh. To cities with deeper ecosystems and more developed infrastructure.

This is not a hypothetical pattern. We saw it with our own members. People who loved Virginia Beach, who wanted to stay, who left because they felt they had no choice.

### The Cost to Virginia Beach

Every entrepreneur who leaves takes something with them. They take their future tax revenue. They take the jobs they would have created. They take the economic activity their company would have generated.

But they also take something harder to measure: their participation in the ecosystem. The mentorship they would have provided to younger founders. The investments they would have made in other companies. The events they would have hosted, the introductions they would have made, the culture they would have shaped.

Brain drain is a compounding problem. Each departure makes the next departure more likely.

### What Retention Requires

Keeping talented people requires giving them reasons to stay. That means infrastructure.

It means having spaces where entrepreneurs can work and connect. It means having programs that support their growth. It means having venues where they can learn and network. It means having a community that understands what they are doing and wants them to succeed.

Virginia Beach has natural advantages, coastal beauty, quality of life, lower cost of living than peer metros, that make it an attractive place to live. The missing piece is the professional infrastructure that makes it an attractive place to build.

## Case Studies: Cities That Got It Right

Virginia Beach does not need to invent innovation infrastructure from scratch. Other cities have done this work and proven what is possible.

### Bell Works (Holmdel, New Jersey)

The example we return to most often is Bell Works, the "metroburb" created in the former Bell Labs research campus in New Jersey.

Developer Somerset Development took a 2-million-square-foot abandoned building and transformed it into a mixed-use community hub. Today it houses coworking space, restaurants, retail, event venues, and public programming.

The results speak for themselves. Bell Works has become a destination. It has created jobs and tax revenue. It has given the surrounding community something it never had: a center for connection and commerce.

The Bell Works model influenced [our proposal for 2200 Parks Avenue](https://arrivalvb.com/proposal). The former MOCA building at 37,000 square feet is much smaller, but the principle is the same: transform underutilized space into community infrastructure that generates economic and social returns.

### Durham, North Carolina

Durham was a declining tobacco town that reinvented itself as an innovation hub. Key to that transformation was infrastructure investment.

The American Tobacco Campus converted old tobacco warehouses into offices, restaurants, and event spaces. Durham's downtown became walkable and activated. The city invested in programs that supported entrepreneurs.

Today Durham is one of the fastest-growing cities in the country. Companies relocate there specifically because of the innovation ecosystem.

### Richmond, Virginia

Closer to home, Richmond invested heavily in innovation infrastructure over the past decade.

The city now has multiple coworking spaces, startup incubators, and creative hubs. Scott's Addition transformed from an industrial district into a vibrant mixed-use neighborhood. The innovation economy is a visible part of Richmond's identity.

Richmond's success shows that Virginia cities can do this. The question is whether Virginia Beach will.

## What Virginia Beach Could Become

Imagine a Virginia Beach where entrepreneurs have places to work and connect. Where artists have studios and galleries. Where the innovation economy is visible and celebrated.

### The Vision

Picture the Oceanfront gateway activated year-round, not just during tourist season. Picture a community hub where coworking members build companies alongside artists creating in their studios. Picture an auditorium hosting pitch nights, concerts, film screenings, and lectures. Picture a culinary incubator where food entrepreneurs launch new concepts.

This is not fantasy. This is what we proposed for [2200 Parks Avenue](https://arrivalvb.com/2200-parks-avenue-virginia-beach-moca/), the former MOCA building. The [community survey](https://arrivalvb.com/community/survey) showed 86% support for exactly this kind of development.

The demand exists. The building exists. The operators with experience exist.

### Economic Impact

Innovation infrastructure pays for itself. The businesses that grow in coworking spaces create jobs and generate tax revenue. The events at community venues draw visitors and spending. The creative economy produces goods and services that export value beyond Virginia Beach.

Our financial projections for Arrival showed $12 million in revenue over five years from a sustainable, diversified business model. That is revenue that stays in Virginia Beach, employing local people and supporting local vendors.

But the economic impact extends beyond the facility itself. The companies incubated in such a space go on to hire employees, lease their own offices, contribute to the tax base. The network effects of innovation infrastructure compound over time.

### Quality of Life

Innovation infrastructure is not just about economics. It is about what kind of city Virginia Beach wants to be.

Cities with vibrant innovation ecosystems feel different. They have energy. They have optimism. They have gathering places where community forms. They give residents reasons to stay and newcomers reasons to come.

Virginia Beach markets itself as a great place to live. Innovation infrastructure would make that claim more complete. It would tell talented people: you can have the beach and the quality of life, but you can also have the professional community and infrastructure you need to build something meaningful.

## The Path Forward

What would it take for Virginia Beach to build the innovation infrastructure it needs?

### Public-Private Partnership

The most successful innovation infrastructure projects involve partnership between public and private sectors.

The public sector contributes what it has: buildings, land, policy support, convening power. The City of Virginia Beach owns properties like the former MOCA building that could be activated for community benefit.

The private sector contributes what it has: operational expertise, entrepreneurial energy, capital, market discipline. Operators like us bring experience running community spaces and sustainable business models.

Neither sector can do it alone. But together, public and private can create something neither could create independently.

### Community Engagement

Innovation infrastructure succeeds when it serves the community. That means listening to what the community wants.

When we conducted our survey, we asked Virginia Beach residents what services they wanted in a community hub. The answers were clear: live events (68%), coworking (66%), art galleries (56%), culinary programming (55%). People told us what they need. The infrastructure should respond to that.

### Long-Term Thinking

Infrastructure is a long-term investment. It takes time to build, and it takes time to generate returns.

Cities that have succeeded with innovation infrastructure committed to a long-term vision. They did not expect overnight results. They built steadily, learned from what worked, and kept investing.

Virginia Beach needs to think the same way. The question is not what will generate immediate returns. The question is what will position Virginia Beach for the next decade and beyond.

## Conclusion: Virginia Beach Deserves Better

Virginia Beach has talent. It has natural beauty. It has quality of life. What it lacks is the infrastructure that would let talented people build things here instead of leaving for cities that already have what they need.

This is a solvable problem. Other cities have solved it. The models exist. The demand exists. The operators exist.

The question is whether Virginia Beach will invest in its own future.

We spent seven years at 1701 proving that innovation infrastructure works in Virginia Beach. We helped 750+ businesses. We built community. We showed that the demand is real.

What Virginia Beach needs now is the will to build at a larger scale. To create the kind of infrastructure that retains talent, attracts companies, and positions the city for the innovation economy.

We remain committed to being part of that solution. If you share this vision, we would welcome the conversation.
