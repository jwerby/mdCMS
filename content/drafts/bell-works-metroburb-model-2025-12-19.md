# The Metroburb Model: What Bell Works Teaches About Community Hubs

When people ask what we envision for Virginia Beach, we often point to Bell Works.

Bell Works is the former Bell Labs research campus in Holmdel, New Jersey. The massive complex where the transistor was invented sat vacant after Bell Labs closed. Developer Somerset Development transformed it into something new: a "metroburb," an urban center within suburbia.

Today Bell Works is a destination. Coworking spaces, restaurants, retail, events, community programming. People come from across the region to work, eat, shop, and gather. What was a vacant liability has become an economic engine.

This transformation inspired [our proposal for 2200 Parks Avenue](https://arrivalvb.com/proposal). Virginia Beach's former MOCA building is much smaller than Bell Works, but the principles apply. Underutilized buildings can become community hubs. Adaptive reuse creates value. The metroburb model works.

## What Is a Metroburb?

The term "metroburb" describes an urban center within a suburban context.

### The Concept

Suburban areas typically lack the density and walkability of urban centers. They have residential neighborhoods, strip malls, and office parks but few true gathering places. People drive everywhere. Community forms around activities rather than locations.

A metroburb fills this gap. It creates a walkable, activated center within otherwise car-dependent suburbs. It gives people a "there" there: a destination where community happens.

The metroburb concept recognizes that many Americans live in suburbs and will continue to. Rather than trying to turn suburbs into cities, metroburbs bring select urban qualities to suburban settings.

### Why It Matters

Metroburbs serve real needs.

**Community formation.** Suburbs lack natural gathering places. Metroburbs provide them. People meet neighbors, form relationships, and build community in ways that suburbs otherwise do not facilitate.

**Economic development.** Activated centers generate economic activity. Jobs, spending, and tax revenue flow to places where people want to be.

**Quality of life.** Having a destination to walk around, eat, shop, and experience events improves daily life. Metroburbs give suburban residents something they otherwise lack.

**Talent retention.** Young professionals often leave suburbs for cities that offer urban experiences. Metroburbs provide some of those experiences locally, helping retain talent.

## The Bell Works Story

Bell Works demonstrates what the metroburb model can achieve.

### The Building

The Bell Labs campus in Holmdel was designed by Eero Saarinen and built in 1962. At 2 million square feet, it housed research that shaped modern technology. The transistor, the laser, Unix, C programming language, and cellular technology all emerged from work done at Bell Labs.

When AT&T divested and research operations consolidated, the building emptied. By 2006, the campus was vacant. Two million square feet of architectural significance sat unused, deteriorating, and dragging down surrounding property values.

### The Transformation

Somerset Development acquired the property and began transforming it into a mixed-use destination.

The strategy was not to fill the building with a single tenant but to create an ecosystem:

**Coworking and office space.** Traditional office tenants alongside flexible coworking options. Workers from various companies share the same building.

**Food and beverage.** Restaurants, cafes, and food vendors create reasons to visit beyond work. The food hall model brings variety and energy.

**Retail.** Shops and services serve both workers and visitors. The retail component creates foot traffic and extends visits.

**Events and programming.** Concerts, markets, exhibitions, and community events draw visitors and activate the space.

**Hotel.** An on-site hotel supports visitors and adds to the 24/7 activity.

**Public space.** Indoor and outdoor gathering areas give people places to sit, meet, and linger.

### The Results

Bell Works has become one of the most successful adaptive reuse projects in the country.

**Economic impact.** The project created hundreds of jobs directly and supports many more indirectly. Tax revenue flows to the township. Property values in the surrounding area have increased.

**Community destination.** Thousands visit Bell Works weekly for work, food, events, and exploration. It has become a gathering place that did not exist before.

**National recognition.** Bell Works has been featured in publications from the New York Times to architectural journals. It has become a model that other communities study.

**Replication.** Somerset Development is now applying the metroburb model to other sites, including a second Bell Works location in Chicago.

## Why Bell Works Succeeded

Understanding what made Bell Works work helps apply the model elsewhere.

### Scale and Ambition

Bell Works succeeded partly because of its ambition.

Somerset Development did not try to find a single use for the building. They created a mixed-use ecosystem with multiple revenue streams and multiple reasons to visit. The diversity of offerings creates resilience and appeal.

This ambition required significant capital investment. Somerset invested hundreds of millions of dollars in renovation. They had the resources and patience to execute a complex, long-term project.

### Architectural Quality

The Saarinen building provided exceptional bones.

The architecture creates dramatic interior spaces. The central "street" running through the building feels urban. Natural light floods through extensive windows. The building's historical significance adds meaning and interest.

Not every building has Bell Labs's architectural distinction. But adaptive reuse works best with buildings that have inherent character worth preserving.

### Programming and Activation

Bell Works did not just fill space. It created programming that activates it.

Events happen regularly. Food vendors rotate. Pop-up experiences create novelty. The calendar of activities gives people reasons to return.

This programming requires ongoing investment and attention. Bell Works has staff dedicated to activating the space, not just managing it.

### Location and Market

Bell Works is located in a wealthy suburban area with limited walkable destinations.

The surrounding market has money to spend and unmet demand for urban experiences. Bell Works serves that market. People who would otherwise drive to Manhattan for dinner or shopping can now find similar experiences locally.

Location matters. The metroburb model works best where suburban markets have purchasing power and limited existing options.

### Partnership with Government

Somerset Development worked constructively with local government.

The township provided regulatory flexibility and tax incentives that made the project viable. In return, the township gained a major employer, tax revenue source, and community amenity.

This [public-private partnership model](https://arrivalvb.com/blog/public-private-partnerships-community-spaces) allowed risks and benefits to be shared appropriately.

## Applying the Model to Virginia Beach

Bell Works offers lessons for Virginia Beach, even if the scale differs dramatically.

### The 2200 Parks Avenue Opportunity

[Our proposal for 2200 Parks Avenue](https://arrivalvb.com/2200-parks-avenue-virginia-beach-moca/) applied metroburb principles to a much smaller building.

The former MOCA building at 37,000 square feet is tiny compared to Bell Works's 2 million. But the underlying concepts translate:

**Mixed-use activation.** Rather than a single use, we proposed coworking, arts, culinary, events, and wellness programming under one roof.

**Community destination.** The goal was creating a gathering place that would draw visitors year-round, not just house tenants.

**Adaptive reuse.** The building has architectural significance and community meaning worth preserving. Adaptive reuse respects that while creating new value.

**Public-private partnership.** The City would contribute the building; we would contribute operating expertise and programming.

### What Would Transfer

Several Bell Works elements would transfer to Virginia Beach:

**Programming focus.** Bell Works succeeds because of what happens there, not just what it is. Events, food, and activation create destination appeal. Any Virginia Beach project should prioritize programming.

**Mixed revenue streams.** Bell Works diversifies revenue across office, retail, F&B, and events. Our proposal similarly diversified across coworking, events, cultural programming, and F&B. Diversity creates resilience.

**Walkable density.** Bell Works creates density within its walls. People can spend hours moving between different experiences. Virginia Beach projects should similarly create enough variety to justify extended visits.

**Community engagement.** Bell Works serves its community's unmet needs. Understanding what Virginia Beach lacks and deliberately filling those gaps would drive adoption.

### What Would Differ

Some Bell Works elements would not transfer directly:

**Scale.** Bell Works's 2-million-square-foot scale enables offerings impossible in smaller buildings. Virginia Beach projects would necessarily be more focused.

**Capital intensity.** Bell Works required hundreds of millions in investment. Virginia Beach projects would need to work with more modest capital.

**Market context.** Holmdel's wealthy suburban market differs from Virginia Beach's mixed resort/residential context. Programming would need to reflect local demographics.

**Existing alternatives.** Bell Works filled a void in its market. Virginia Beach has some existing gathering spaces, though not enough. Any new project would complement existing options rather than create something entirely unprecedented.

## Lessons for Community Hub Development

Beyond the specific Bell Works case, the metroburb model teaches broader lessons.

### Activation Over Tenanting

The goal is not to fill space but to create activity.

Traditional real estate thinks in terms of leasing square footage. The metroburb model thinks in terms of creating reasons to visit. Activity generates value. Space filling is just one means to that end.

Community hub developers should ask: "What will make people come here?" before asking "Who will rent this space?"

### Experience Economy

People increasingly value experiences over things.

Bell Works sells experiences: the experience of eating in an interesting building, the experience of attending events in a unique venue, the experience of working alongside other interesting people.

Community hubs should design for experience. The physical space matters less than what people feel while they are there.

### Patience and Long-Term Thinking

Bell Works took years to develop and more years to reach its current success.

Somerset Development did not expect immediate returns. They invested for long-term value creation. The project required patience that most developers lack.

Community hubs need similar long-term thinking. Building community takes time. Programming requires sustained investment. The returns compound over years, not quarters.

### Place Identity

Bell Works has a clear identity: the place where Bell Labs happened, now reborn as a modern community hub.

That identity provides meaning. Visitors connect with the history. Workers feel they are part of something significant. The identity differentiates Bell Works from generic alternatives.

Community hubs benefit from identity. The former MOCA building has identity as a cultural venue. The ViBe Creative District has identity as an arts community. Identity creates attachment that generic space cannot.

## Why Virginia Beach Needs This Thinking

Virginia Beach faces challenges that the metroburb model addresses.

### Suburban Sprawl

Much of Virginia Beach is suburban: residential neighborhoods, strip malls, car-dependent development.

The city lacks sufficient walkable destinations. People drive to the Oceanfront or the ViBe for destination experiences. The rest of the city has few equivalents.

Creating metroburb-style gathering places in suburban areas would improve quality of life for residents who do not live near existing destinations.

### Seasonal Economy

Virginia Beach's resort economy is heavily seasonal.

Year-round activated spaces like Bell Works could reduce seasonal dependency. A destination that offers events, coworking, and programming year-round would draw activity regardless of beach weather.

### Talent Competition

Virginia Beach competes for talent against metros with more developed urban amenities.

Metroburb-style developments would give Virginia Beach some of what urban metros offer. People who want walkable, activated environments would find them locally.

### Underutilized Assets

Virginia Beach has buildings and properties that could become community hubs.

The former MOCA building is one example. Other underutilized city properties exist. Thinking about these assets through a metroburb lens would reveal opportunities.

## The Arrival Vision

Our proposal for 2200 Parks Avenue was Virginia Beach's metroburb opportunity.

We proposed:
- Coworking space serving entrepreneurs and remote workers
- Gallery and exhibition space continuing the building's cultural legacy
- A 300-seat auditorium for performances, screenings, and events
- Culinary programming including an incubator kitchen and public cafe
- Wellness programming in flexible studio space
- Outdoor activation of the 9.6-acre grounds

This mix would have created a destination. People would come for coworking and stay for lunch. They would attend evening events. They would bring visitors to experience the space. The various uses would reinforce each other.

The [community survey](https://arrivalvb.com/community/survey) showed 86% support for this concept. The demand exists. The model is proven. What was missing was the partnership to make it happen.

## Conclusion: The Model Works

Bell Works proves that the metroburb model works. Underutilized buildings can become community destinations. Mixed-use activation creates value. Public-private partnerships enable transformation.

Virginia Beach has opportunities to apply these lessons. The former MOCA building is the most obvious, but not the only possibility. Any underutilized property with architectural character could potentially become a community hub.

The requirements are:
- Vision for mixed-use activation
- Programming focus, not just space filling
- Long-term thinking and patient capital
- Partnership between public and private sectors
- Understanding of local market needs

We remain committed to bringing metroburb thinking to Virginia Beach. Our experience at [1701](https://arrivalvb.com/1701) taught us what community spaces can achieve. The Bell Works model shows what is possible at larger scale.

Virginia Beach deserves gathering places that bring community together. The metroburb model shows how to create them. The question is whether the city and region will invest in making it happen.
