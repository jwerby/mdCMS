# ViBe Creative District: The Heart of Virginia Beach's Creative Economy

Ten years ago, the blocks between 17th and 19th Streets in Virginia Beach were easy to overlook. Warehouses. Light industrial buildings. The kind of neighborhood you drove through on your way somewhere else.

Today, the [ViBe Creative District](https://vibecreativedistrict.org/) is a destination. Galleries, studios, restaurants, breweries, and creative businesses have transformed these blocks into the cultural heart of Virginia Beach. First Friday art walks draw thousands. Local artists have actual places to work and show their art. A creative economy has taken root.

We were part of this transformation. [1701](https://arrivalvb.com/1701), Virginia Beach's first coworking space, opened in the ViBe in 2016. [Fathom Coffee](https://arrivalvb.com/portfolio/fathom-coffee), our specialty roastery, operates there today. Lisa serves on the ViBe Creative District Board. This neighborhood is not just where we worked; it is the community we helped build.

As the ViBe celebrates 10 years in 2025, this is the story of what makes the district work, what it has achieved, and what it teaches us about creative placemaking in Virginia Beach.

## The ViBe Story: How It Started

The ViBe Creative District did not happen by accident. It took vision, organization, and years of work by artists and advocates who believed this neighborhood could be something more.

### Before the ViBe

The area that became the ViBe was historically industrial and commercial. Warehouses, auto shops, and small businesses occupied the blocks. The buildings had character but little cohesive identity.

Artists had been quietly discovering the neighborhood for years. The warehouse spaces were affordable. The buildings had the bones that creative work requires: high ceilings, good light, room to spread out. Individual artists established studios, but they operated in isolation.

What changed was organization.

### The Founding Vision

In 2015, a group of artists, business owners, and community advocates came together to formalize what was already emerging organically. They established the ViBe Creative District as a designated arts and cultural district.

The vision was straightforward: create the conditions for creative businesses to thrive. That meant branding and marketing the district. It meant advocating for zoning and policies that supported arts uses. It meant programming events that drew visitors. It meant building community among the businesses already there.

The name "ViBe" captured the aspiration: Virginia Beach's creative energy, concentrated and cultivated.

### Early Growth

The district's growth accelerated once it had a name and an organization behind it.

New businesses opened. Existing businesses expanded. The foot traffic from one establishment benefited its neighbors. A gallery opening drew people who discovered the restaurant next door. A coffee shop attracted remote workers who noticed the studio across the street.

We opened 1701 in 2016, the district's first year. The timing was not coincidental. We saw what the ViBe was becoming and wanted to be part of it. The creative energy of the neighborhood matched the community we wanted to build.

## What the ViBe Has Achieved

Ten years later, the results speak for themselves.

### By the Numbers

The ViBe Creative District's impact can be measured:

- **65+ businesses** now operate within the district
- **$33.9 million** increase in gross sales since 2012
- **$56 million** increase in real estate values
- Thousands of visitors during First Friday art walks
- A distinct identity recognized throughout Hampton Roads

These numbers represent real economic impact. Jobs created. Taxes paid. Investment attracted. The ViBe transformed from overlooked industrial blocks to a valued economic asset.

### The Business Ecosystem

Walk through the ViBe today and you encounter a diverse creative ecosystem.

**Galleries and studios.** Working artists have space to create and show their work. The Charles H. Taylor Arts Center anchors the arts programming. Private galleries host rotating exhibitions.

**Food and beverage.** Restaurants, breweries, and coffee shops have clustered in the district. Fathom Coffee, where we roast specialty coffee, is part of this community. These establishments draw visitors who discover the rest of the district.

**Creative services.** Design firms, photographers, marketing agencies, and other creative service businesses have made the ViBe their home. They benefit from proximity to other creatives and the district's identity.

**Retail.** Boutiques, makers' shops, and specialty retail cater to visitors seeking unique products. Local artists sell their work alongside curated goods.

This ecosystem creates mutual benefit. Each business draws customers who discover others. The whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts.

### Cultural Programming

Events and programming drive the ViBe's vitality.

**First Friday art walks.** Monthly events bring the community together for gallery openings, live music, and street activity. These have become signature Virginia Beach experiences.

**Festivals and markets.** The district hosts seasonal events that draw visitors from across the region. Farmers markets, art fairs, and cultural celebrations activate the streets.

**Educational programming.** Classes and workshops in various creative disciplines make the ViBe a place for learning, not just viewing.

This programming matters because it creates reasons to visit. A static collection of businesses attracts less foot traffic than an activated district with regular events.

## What Makes the ViBe Work

The ViBe's success offers lessons for creative placemaking anywhere.

### Authentic Creative Foundation

The ViBe works because it has real artists doing real work.

Some arts districts are artificial, created by developers who want the aesthetic without the substance. They put galleries in retail spaces but lack working artists. They have the look but not the culture.

The ViBe is different. Working artists established studios here before the district was formalized. The district grew from genuine creative activity, not from top-down planning.

This authenticity matters. Visitors can tell the difference between a real arts community and a branded shopping district. The ViBe has substance because it has actual artists creating actual art.

### Walkability and Density

The ViBe occupies a compact geography. You can walk from one end to the other in minutes. Businesses are close enough that visitors naturally explore.

This density creates collision. The person who came for coffee discovers the gallery next door. The couple who came for dinner wanders into a studio. These unplanned discoveries drive the district's appeal.

Sprawl would undermine this dynamic. If the same businesses were scattered across miles, the district would not work. Concentration creates community.

### Organizational Infrastructure

Behind the ViBe's organic feel is serious organizational work.

The ViBe Creative District organization coordinates marketing and promotion. It advocates with city government on zoning and policy. It organizes First Friday events and other programming. It provides a voice for the district's businesses.

This infrastructure is invisible to visitors but essential to success. Someone has to plan the events. Someone has to market the district. Someone has to navigate city hall. The organization does this work so individual businesses can focus on their craft.

Lisa's service on the ViBe board gives us inside perspective on this work. It is substantial, and it is necessary.

### Supportive Policy Environment

The City of Virginia Beach has generally supported the ViBe's development.

The official designation as a creative district provided legitimacy and focus. Zoning flexibility allowed arts-related uses that might not fit elsewhere. Infrastructure investments improved the district's physical environment.

This support matters. Cities can make creative districts easier or harder to establish. Virginia Beach, to its credit, made room for the ViBe to grow.

## Challenges the ViBe Faces

Ten years of success does not mean the ViBe's future is guaranteed. Real challenges remain.

### Rising Costs

Success brings its own problems. As the ViBe has grown more desirable, real estate costs have increased.

The same affordability that initially attracted artists is eroding. Studios that were cheap a decade ago now command higher rents. Some artists have been priced out or face the prospect of displacement.

This is the classic arts district paradox. Artists create value by making a neighborhood desirable. That desirability increases costs, which displaces the artists who created the value.

The ViBe has not solved this problem. No arts district has. But it is a tension that requires ongoing attention.

### Infrastructure Limitations

The ViBe's physical infrastructure has limits.

Parking is constrained. The streets were not designed for the foot traffic that First Fridays generate. Some buildings need investment to serve their current uses effectively.

These are manageable problems, but they require investment. Infrastructure improvements take money and coordination between private owners and public agencies.

### Competition for Attention

As the ViBe has succeeded, other Virginia Beach neighborhoods have sought similar designations and attention.

Competition is not inherently bad. More creative districts could expand the overall creative economy. But resources and attention are limited. The ViBe must continue demonstrating value to maintain support.

## The ViBe's Connection to Our Work

Our history is intertwined with the ViBe's development.

### 1701 in the ViBe

When we opened 1701 in 2016, we chose the ViBe deliberately. The neighborhood's creative energy matched our vision for a coworking community that would serve entrepreneurs, freelancers, and remote workers.

For seven years, 1701 was part of the ViBe ecosystem. Our members patronized ViBe restaurants and coffee shops. They attended First Friday events. They collaborated with other ViBe businesses.

The relationship was mutual. 1701 brought daytime foot traffic to the district. Coworking members became regulars at neighboring establishments. The district's appeal attracted members to 1701.

When 1701 closed in 2023, we remained committed to the ViBe. The community we built there continues even without the physical space.

### Fathom Coffee

[Fathom Coffee](https://arrivalvb.com/portfolio/fathom-coffee), our specialty coffee roastery at 1682 Baltic Avenue, continues our ViBe presence.

Bob Werby, Jeff's father, roasts small-batch specialty coffee using a unique solar-powered approach. We offer 21 coffees on tap. The shop has become a gathering place for the ViBe community.

Fathom represents what we love about the ViBe: craft, community, and the collision of creative people. Our customers include artists from nearby studios, professionals from surrounding businesses, and visitors exploring the district.

### Board Service

Lisa's service on the ViBe Creative District Board gives us ongoing connection to the district's leadership.

Board work involves strategic planning, event coordination, advocacy, and the countless small decisions that shape a district's development. It is unpaid, largely invisible, and essential.

This service reflects our commitment to the ViBe beyond any single business. We believe in what the district represents and want to see it thrive.

## What the ViBe Teaches Virginia Beach

The ViBe's success offers lessons for Virginia Beach's broader development.

### Creative Economy Matters

The arts are not a luxury. They are an economic engine.

According to Americans for the Arts research, arts and culture contribute significantly to local economies through jobs, spending, and tax revenue. The ViBe demonstrates this locally: $33.9 million in increased gross sales is real money.

Virginia Beach should invest in creative infrastructure because it generates economic returns, not just because art is nice.

### Place Matters

The ViBe proves that place quality matters for economic development.

People want to spend time in attractive, activated neighborhoods. They will drive past strip malls to reach walkable districts with character. The ViBe draws visitors specifically because of what it is, not just what individual businesses offer.

Virginia Beach has other neighborhoods that could benefit from similar investment in place quality. The ViBe provides a template.

### Community Organizing Works

The ViBe exists because people organized to make it happen.

Government alone did not create the district. Individual businesses alone did not create the district. Organized community effort, coordinating private and public resources toward a shared vision, created the district.

This organizing model applies to other Virginia Beach challenges. When community members come together with a clear vision and sustained commitment, things change.

## The ViBe's Next 10 Years

As the ViBe enters its second decade, questions about its future remain open.

### Maintaining Authenticity

Can the ViBe stay real as it becomes more successful?

The district needs strategies to maintain artist presence even as costs rise. That might mean dedicated affordable studio space, artist housing initiatives, or other interventions. Without intentional effort, market forces will push out the artists who made the district valuable.

### Expanding Programming

The ViBe could do more with programming and events.

The foundation is strong, but there is room to grow. More educational programming. More cultural events. More reasons for people to visit regularly, not just monthly.

This requires resources. The ViBe organization operates on limited budget. Expanding programming requires expanding capacity.

### Physical Investment

Some ViBe infrastructure needs attention.

Streetscaping, parking, lighting, signage. The physical environment could be improved. These improvements require partnership between the city, property owners, and the district organization.

### Regional Connection

The ViBe could be better connected to other Virginia Beach assets.

The Oceanfront is blocks away. The future of 2200 Parks Avenue, whatever it becomes, is nearby. The ViBe could be part of a larger connected experience that keeps visitors in the area longer.

This was part of [our vision for Arrival](https://arrivalvb.com/proposal). A community hub at 2200 Parks Avenue would connect to the ViBe, creating mutual benefit. The concepts remain sound even if the specific opportunity has passed.

## Conclusion: Celebrating 10 Years

The ViBe Creative District celebrates 10 years in 2025. That milestone deserves recognition.

What has happened in these blocks is remarkable. A neighborhood that was easy to overlook became a destination. Artists who worked in isolation found community. Businesses that might have located anywhere chose to cluster together. Economic value was created from creative energy.

We are proud to have been part of this story. 1701 was born in the ViBe's early days. Fathom Coffee continues there today. Lisa's board service connects us to the district's ongoing work.

The ViBe shows what Virginia Beach can achieve when creative people come together with a shared vision. It proves that arts and culture matter economically, not just aesthetically. It demonstrates that place quality drives development.

Ten years is worth celebrating. The next ten years will determine whether the ViBe deepens its success or succumbs to the pressures that undermine arts districts elsewhere.

We are betting on success. And we will continue to be part of making it happen.
