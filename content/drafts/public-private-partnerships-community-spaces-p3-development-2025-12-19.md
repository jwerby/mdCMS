# Public-Private Partnerships for Community Spaces: A Model That Works

The old way of building community infrastructure is broken.

Municipalities lack the operating expertise to run community spaces efficiently. Private developers lack the civic mandate and public trust. Neither sector alone can create the kind of spaces that communities need.

But together, public and private can build something neither could create independently.

Public-private partnerships, or P3s, have transformed how cities develop community infrastructure. From adaptive reuse projects that turn abandoned buildings into vibrant hubs, to innovation districts that reshape regional economies, the P3 model has proven it works.

This is the model we proposed for [2200 Parks Avenue](https://arrivalvb.com/2200-parks-avenue-virginia-beach-moca/), the former MOCA building in Virginia Beach. The City owns the building. We have the operating expertise from [seven years running 1701](https://arrivalvb.com/1701). Together, we could create something that serves the community while operating sustainably.

Here is how public-private partnerships work, why they succeed, and what Virginia Beach can learn from cities that have embraced this model.

## What Public-Private Partnerships Actually Are

A public-private partnership is exactly what it sounds like: a collaboration between government and private entities to deliver public infrastructure or services.

### The Basic Structure

In a typical P3 for community space:

**The public sector contributes:**
- Real estate (buildings, land)
- Regulatory support (zoning, permits)
- Convening power (connections, legitimacy)
- Sometimes capital (grants, loans, tax incentives)

**The private sector contributes:**
- Operating expertise (how to run the space)
- Entrepreneurial energy (innovation, responsiveness)
- Private capital (investment, risk tolerance)
- Market discipline (sustainability focus)

The partnership allows each sector to do what it does best while the other fills the gaps.

### Why This Model Has Grown

P3s for community infrastructure have increased dramatically over the past two decades. Several factors drive this growth:

**Municipal budget constraints.** Cities struggle to fund new community facilities and maintain existing ones. P3s bring private capital and operational efficiency that reduce public costs.

**Complexity of modern community spaces.** Running a successful community hub requires hospitality skills, event management, technology infrastructure, and community programming. These are not traditional government competencies.

**Demand for innovation.** Communities want spaces that evolve with their needs. Private operators can adapt more quickly than government-run facilities.

**Successful precedents.** As more P3 community projects succeed, other cities gain confidence in the model.

## Case Studies: P3s That Transformed Communities

The best argument for public-private partnerships is the evidence. Let us look at projects that demonstrate what this model can achieve.

### Bell Works: The Metroburb Model

The most inspiring example of P3 community development is Bell Works in Holmdel, New Jersey.

**The Setup:** Bell Labs, the legendary research campus where the transistor was invented, closed in 2007. The 2-million-square-foot complex sat vacant, dragging down property values and providing zero benefit to the community.

**The Partnership:** Somerset Development partnered with the Township of Holmdel to transform the campus into a "metroburb," an urban center within suburbia. The township provided regulatory support and tax incentives. Somerset invested private capital and brought operational expertise.

**The Result:** Today Bell Works houses coworking spaces, restaurants, a hotel, retail stores, event venues, and community programming. It has become a destination that draws visitors from across the region. The project created hundreds of jobs and generated significant tax revenue.

Bell Works proves that P3s can transform white elephants into community assets. The building that was a liability became an economic engine.

### The American Tobacco Campus (Durham, NC)

Durham's transformation from declining tobacco town to innovation hub was accelerated by P3 development.

**The Setup:** The American Tobacco company's historic factories sat abandoned after manufacturing moved overseas. The buildings were deteriorating but historically significant.

**The Partnership:** Private developers partnered with the City of Durham on adaptive reuse. The city contributed infrastructure investments and regulatory flexibility. Private partners invested in renovation and took responsibility for operations.

**The Result:** The American Tobacco Campus now houses offices, restaurants, entertainment venues, and public spaces. It anchors Durham's revitalized downtown and serves as home base for the city's innovation economy.

### Ponce City Market (Atlanta, GA)

Atlanta's Ponce City Market demonstrates P3 success in adaptive reuse of industrial buildings.

**The Setup:** The former Sears, Roebuck & Co. building sat underutilized for decades. At 2.1 million square feet, it was too large for any single tenant.

**The Partnership:** Jamestown Properties partnered with the City of Atlanta on redevelopment. The city contributed tax increment financing and infrastructure improvements. Jamestown invested hundreds of millions in renovation.

**The Result:** Ponce City Market is now a mixed-use destination with offices, retail, restaurants, and a rooftop amusement park. It has become one of Atlanta's most visited attractions and a catalyst for neighborhood revitalization.

## Why P3s Work for Community Spaces

The success stories above share common elements that explain why public-private partnerships work for community infrastructure.

### Aligned Incentives

The best P3s create alignment between public and private goals.

The public sector wants community benefit: activated spaces, economic development, quality of life improvements. The private sector wants sustainable operations: revenue, manageable costs, long-term viability.

When structured correctly, achieving private sustainability requires delivering public benefit. A community space that serves the community attracts members, renters, and visitors. Serving the community IS the business model.

This alignment is fundamental. P3s fail when public and private incentives diverge. They succeed when both parties win by achieving the same outcomes.

### Complementary Capabilities

Government and private enterprise have different strengths.

Government excels at:
- Long-term planning and vision
- Land and property ownership
- Regulatory authority
- Democratic legitimacy
- Convening diverse stakeholders

Private operators excel at:
- Day-to-day management
- Customer service and hospitality
- Financial discipline and efficiency
- Innovation and adaptation
- Speed of decision-making

A P3 combines these capabilities. The government provides the foundation; the private operator builds on it. Neither could succeed alone.

### Risk Distribution

Community spaces involve risk. Construction risk, demand risk, operational risk, financial risk.

In a P3, risk is distributed to the party best equipped to manage it.

The public sector typically bears real estate risk; it owns the building regardless. The private sector typically bears operational risk; it controls day-to-day decisions. Both parties share demand risk; success depends on community adoption.

This distribution makes projects viable that neither sector would take on alone. The public sector avoids operating a facility outside its expertise. The private sector avoids the capital burden of acquiring major real estate.

### Long-Term Perspective

P3s typically involve long-term agreements, often 10 to 30 years or more.

This long-term horizon enables investments that would not make sense in shorter arrangements. Operators can invest in building community, knowing they will benefit from that investment over time. They can make capital improvements, knowing they will operate long enough to recoup the cost.

The long-term perspective also creates accountability. Operators cannot cut corners for short-term gain if they will live with the consequences for decades.

## What Makes P3s Succeed or Fail

Not all public-private partnerships work. Understanding why some fail helps structure partnerships that succeed.

### Success Factors

**Clear roles and responsibilities.** Each party must know what it is responsible for and what the other party handles. Ambiguity creates conflict.

**Realistic financial projections.** Projects fail when financial models are too optimistic. Successful P3s are built on conservative assumptions with contingency plans.

**Community input.** P3s that ignore community preferences fail to attract users. Successful projects engage the community from the beginning and throughout operations.

**Flexible agreements.** Circumstances change over 10 to 30 years. Agreements need mechanisms to adapt without renegotiating everything.

**Experienced operators.** Running community spaces is difficult. Operators need relevant track record, not just good intentions.

**Political continuity.** P3s span multiple election cycles. They need support that transcends individual administrations.

### Common Failure Modes

**Misaligned incentives.** When the private partner can profit by reducing public benefit, problems emerge. Agreements must tie private success to public outcomes.

**Undercapitalization.** Projects that start without adequate capital often fail. Private partners must have resources to weather early losses and unexpected costs.

**Over-promising.** Projects that promise more than they can deliver lose public trust. Realistic expectations, clearly communicated, build lasting support.

**Poor communication.** P3s require ongoing communication between partners. When communication breaks down, small problems become large ones.

**Inflexible agreements.** Rigidity prevents adaptation to changing circumstances. Agreements that cannot evolve become obstacles.

## The Arrival Proposal: A P3 Vision for Virginia Beach

Our proposal for [2200 Parks Avenue](https://arrivalvb.com/proposal) followed the P3 model precisely.

### What the City Would Contribute

The City of Virginia Beach owns the former MOCA building. This 37,000-square-foot facility sits on 9.6 acres at the gateway to the Oceanfront Resort District. The building is architecturally significant and structurally sound but currently underutilized.

Under our proposal, the City would:
- Lease the building to Arrival on long-term terms
- Provide regulatory support for the intended uses
- Contribute convening power to engage the community

The City would retain ownership of a valuable asset while seeing it activated for community benefit.

### What Arrival Would Contribute

We would bring what we have: operating expertise, community relationships, and a sustainable business model.

Under our proposal, Arrival would:
- Invest private capital in facility improvements
- Operate the space with professional management
- Deliver programming across coworking, arts, culinary, and events
- Assume responsibility for financial sustainability

Our [financial projections](https://arrivalvb.com/proposal/financials) showed $12 million in revenue over five years from diversified sources. This was not wishful thinking; it was a conservative model built on our experience at 1701.

### Why This Partnership Made Sense

The City has a building it does not know what to do with. We have seven years of experience operating community spaces in Virginia Beach. The partnership would combine what the City has (the building) with what we have (the capability to activate it).

The [community survey](https://arrivalvb.com/community/survey) showed 86% support for the concept. The demand exists. The asset exists. The operators exist.

What was missing was the partnership.

## What Virginia Beach Can Learn

The RFI for 2200 Parks Avenue was canceled before a decision was made. We still do not know exactly why. But the principles of public-private partnership remain valid regardless of what happened with one specific process.

### The P3 Model Applies to Many Assets

Virginia Beach owns numerous properties that could benefit from P3 development. The former MOCA building is one example, but not the only one.

The city has parks, community centers, and underutilized facilities throughout its boundaries. P3s could activate these assets, delivering community benefit without straining municipal budgets.

### Experience Matters

One lesson from successful P3s: operator experience is predictive of project success.

When evaluating P3 proposals, cities should weight track record heavily. Has the operator run similar facilities? Do they understand the local market? Do they have the community relationships to drive adoption?

We built 1701 from nothing and operated it successfully for seven years. We helped 750+ businesses. We know what Virginia Beach's entrepreneurial and creative communities need because we served them directly.

### Community Engagement is Essential

P3s work best when the community is engaged from the beginning.

We conducted a survey before finalizing our proposal. We asked Virginia Beach residents what services they wanted. The responses shaped our concept. Live events, coworking, art galleries, and culinary programming rose to the top.

This was not box-checking. It was genuine market research that informed what we proposed. Communities support projects that serve their stated needs.

### Long-Term Thinking Pays Off

P3s are not quick fixes. They require patience, investment, and long-term commitment from both partners.

Cities that embrace P3s must think beyond the current budget cycle. The benefits of community infrastructure compound over time. The businesses incubated in a coworking space go on to create jobs for decades. The cultural programming at an arts venue shapes community identity for generations.

Short-term thinking misses these long-term returns.

## Conclusion: Partnership as the Path Forward

Virginia Beach faces the same challenges as other cities: limited budgets, underutilized assets, community needs that exceed municipal capacity to address.

Public-private partnerships offer a path forward. They combine what government has with what private operators can do. They create sustainable community infrastructure that serves public benefit through market discipline.

The model works. The evidence from Bell Works, Durham, Atlanta, and dozens of other cities proves it.

Virginia Beach has opportunities to apply this model. The former MOCA building at 2200 Parks Avenue is one. Other properties throughout the city are others.

What is needed is commitment to the approach. A willingness to partner with experienced operators who bring complementary capabilities. A long-term perspective that values community benefit over quick returns. A process that engages the community and selects partners based on capability and track record.

We remain ready to be a partner in that approach. Our experience at 1701 prepared us for exactly this kind of collaboration. We understand what Virginia Beach needs because we spent seven years serving it.

If you share the vision for P3 community development in Virginia Beach, we would welcome the conversation.
