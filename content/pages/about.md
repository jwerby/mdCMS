# About Arrival

## Our Mission

Arrival exists to accelerate the growth of Virginia Beach's business community. We believe this region has untapped potential, and we're committed to helping local businesses reach new heights.

## Why We Do This

Virginia Beach and Hampton Roads represent one of the most promising emerging business ecosystems on the East Coast. With a strategic location, deep talent pool from military transitions, and improving quality of life, the region is primed for growth.

But many businesses here lack access to the expertise, capital, and connections that companies in major metros take for granted. Arrival bridges that gap.

## Our Approach

We take a hands-on, relationship-first approach to everything we do:

- **Long-term partnerships** over transactional relationships
- **Practical advice** grounded in real business experience
- **Regional focus** with national-level expertise
- **Founder-friendly** terms and practices

## Our Team

Our team combines decades of experience in business operations, recruiting, finance, and entrepreneurship. We've built and sold companies, hired hundreds of employees, and invested in dozens of startups.

Most importantly, we're committed to Virginia Beach. This is our home, and we're invested in its success.

## Get Involved

Whether you're a business looking for growth support, a professional interested in opportunities, or someone who wants to contribute to the local ecosystem, we'd love to hear from you.
