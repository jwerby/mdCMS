More on that below.\n\n## The Virginia MOCA's Farewell to Parks Avenue\n\nThe **virginia moca bids farewell** to Parks Avenue, but its impact will last for years to come. The Virginia MOCA has been a vital part of the Virginia Beach community since 1986. But before the museum makes its move to Virginia Wesleyan University, let's take a look back at the legacy it leaves behind and the exciting events planned to commemorate this transition.\n\n### A Look Back at MOCA's Legacy\n\nFor nearly four decades, the Virginia MOCA has enriched the cultural landscape of Virginia Beach. It has showcased a diverse range of contemporary art, hosted thought-provoking exhibitions, and provided educational programs that have inspired countless individuals. As the **virginia moca bids farewell**, it's important to remember its contributions.\n\nThe MOCA has:\n\n*   **Championed emerging and established artists:** Providing a platform for artists to showcase their work and connect with audiences.\n*   **Offered engaging educational programs:** Inspiring creativity and fostering an appreciation for contemporary art among children, teens, and adults.\n*   **Served as a community gathering place:** Hosting events, workshops, and discussions that have brought people together to celebrate art and culture.\n\nThe **virginia moca bids farewell**, but its contributions to the Virginia Beach arts scene are undeniable, and its legacy will continue to inspire for years to come.\n\n### Details of the Farewell Events\n\nBefore the MOCA closes its doors at its Parks Avenue location, the community has two opportunities to celebrate its legacy and support its future as the **virginia moca bids farewell**:\n\n1.  **Farewell Party & Silent Auction (January 10th, 6-10 PM):** Enjoy art, food, beverages, and live music while supporting Virginia MOCA's exhibitions and education programs.

But why the move, and what can we expect from the MOCA in its new home? The **virginia moca bids farewell** to its old location, but is looking forward.\n\n### Why the Move?\n\nWhile the Virginia MOCA has thrived at its Parks Avenue location, several factors contributed to the decision to relocate:\n\n*   **Building Repairs and Maintenance:** The existing facility requires significant repairs and maintenance work, estimated at around \\$900,000, according to the city.\n*   **Environmental Constraints:** The Parks Avenue property faces environmental challenges, including being located within a flood hazard zone, containing wetlands, and being near the Chesapeake Bay Resource Protection Area.\n*   **City's Perspective:** The City of Virginia Beach owns the Parks Avenue property and has been exploring alternative uses for the land.\n\n> \"The building needs roughly \\$900,000 in repairs and maintenance work, and the land has significant environmental constraints, according to the city.\"\n\nThe move to Virginia Wesleyan offers the MOCA a custom-built facility with expanded education and exhibition space, allowing it to better serve its mission and the community. The **virginia moca bids farewell** to these challenges.\n\n### What's Next for MOCA at Virginia Wesleyan?\n\nThe Virginia MOCA's new home at Virginia Wesleyan University promises exciting opportunities for growth and innovation. The custom-built facility will expand the museum's education and exhibition space by 20%, providing more room to showcase contemporary art and engage with the community. The **virginia moca bids farewell** and looks ahead to new opportunities.\n\nThe museum is scheduled to open to the public at its new location on April 18th, and the inaugural exhibition will feature the work of contemporary painter Nina Chanel Abney.\n\n## The Future of 2200 Parks Avenue\n\nWith the Virginia MOCA moving to Virginia Wesleyan University, the question arises: what's next for the 9.6-acre property at 2200 Parks Avenue? As the **virginia moca bids farewell**, the community wonders what's next for the space.\n\n### The City's Plans for the Former MOCA Site\n\nThe City of Virginia Beach owns the Parks Avenue property and has been exploring options for its future use. In April, the city issued a request for ideas (RFI) to lease the property, receiving nine proposals. However, in September, the City Council chose to cancel the solicitation and explore other options through an advisory group, according to a city spokesperson. The **virginia moca bids farewell**, and the city reconsiders the space.\n\n> \"Last April, the city issued a request for ideas to lease it and received nine proposals.

We proudly helped over 750 businesses through membership, innovative programming, and a strong sense of community, and we celebrated as 40+ businesses graduated to their own dedicated office locations.\n\nAt 1701, we learned that community spaces need engaging programming, not just square footage. A room filled with desks isn't truly a coworking space - it's simply a room with desks. What truly makes it work is the carefully curated events, the meaningful introductions, and the vibrant culture you intentionally build. That invaluable experience directly informs our exciting vision for the former MOCA site.\n\n### Partnering with Local Artists and Organizations\n\nWe firmly believe in the power of collaboration and are deeply committed to partnering with talented local artists, established organizations, and thriving businesses to create a vibrant and sustainable arts and culture ecosystem in Virginia Beach. We envision a dynamic space where artists have access to affordable studio space, exciting exhibition opportunities, and enriching educational programs that foster creativity and growth.\n\nWe also recognize the critical importance of supporting local food entrepreneurs and providing a welcoming gathering place for the community through a culinary incubator and cafe that celebrates local flavors and fosters culinary innovation.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe **Virginia MOCA's** carefully planned move to Virginia Wesleyan University marks the end of a significant era but also the exciting beginning of a vibrant new chapter filled with endless possibilities. As the museum thoughtfully prepares to embark on this transformative journey, we wholeheartedly celebrate its remarkable legacy and eagerly look forward to its continued contributions to the Virginia Beach community.\n\nAt the same time, we recognize the unique opportunity to thoughtfully reimagine the former MOCA site as a vibrant hub for creativity, innovation, and meaningful community engagement. We firmly believe our ambitious vision for a \"Metroburb\" that seamlessly combines coworking, arts, culinary innovation, and engaging community events would revitalize the property and significantly contribute to the continued growth and vibrancy of Virginia Beach.\n\nWe warmly invite you to:\n\n*   **Learn more about Arrival's vision** for the former MOCA site by visiting our website.\n*   **Contact us** to discuss exciting partnership opportunities and share your innovative ideas for the future of arts and culture in Virginia Beach.\n\nLet's work together to create a thriving arts and culture scene that enriches the lives of all who call Virginia Beach home. Because in Virginia Beach, Ideas Make Landfall at Arrival.\n\n---\n\n**Word Count:** 2700+\n\n---",

It's been a place where creativity flourished, artists found a platform, and the community gathered to experience the power of contemporary art. Now, as the MOCA prepares to embark on a new journey to Virginia Wesleyan University, it's a bittersweet moment for our community.\n\nAt Arrival VB, we understand the vital role that arts and culture play in a thriving city. We believe Virginia Beach deserves world-class infrastructure for innovation and culture, and we're committed to being part of that future.

Mark your calendars for a fundraiser on January 10th and a free community event on January 11th. It's a chance to say goodbye, celebrate the past, and support the MOCA's future endeavors. More on that below.\n\n## The Virginia MOCA's Farewell to Parks Avenue\n\nThe Virginia MOCA has been a vital part of the Virginia Beach community since 1986. But before the museum makes its move to Virginia Wesleyan University, let's take a look back at the legacy it leaves behind and the exciting events planned to commemorate this transition.\n\n### A Look Back at MOCA's Legacy\n\nFor nearly four decades, the Virginia MOCA has enriched the cultural landscape of Virginia Beach. It has showcased a diverse range of contemporary art, hosted thought-provoking exhibitions, and provided educational programs that have inspired countless individuals.\n\nThe MOCA has:\n\n*   **Championed emerging and established artists:** Providing a platform for artists to showcase their work and connect with audiences.\n*   **Offered engaging educational programs:** Inspiring creativity and fostering an appreciation for contemporary art among children, teens, and adults.\n*   **Served as a community gathering place:** Hosting events, workshops, and discussions that have brought people together to celebrate art and culture.\n\nThe Virginia MOCA's contributions to the Virginia Beach arts scene are undeniable, and its legacy will continue to inspire for years to come.\n\n### Details of the Farewell Events\n\nBefore the MOCA closes its doors at its Parks Avenue location, the community has two opportunities to celebrate its legacy and support its future:\n\n1.  **Farewell Party & Silent Auction (January 10th, 6-10 PM):** Enjoy art, food, beverages, and live music while supporting Virginia MOCA's exhibitions and education programs. A highlight of the evening will be a silent auction featuring best-in-show artworks from decades of the Boardwalk Art Show.\n    *   **Cost:** \\$25 for members, \\$50 for non-members\n2.  **Community Celebration (January 11th, 10 AM - 4 PM):** A daylong free event featuring art demos, artist pop-up talks, and Doodlefest, an interactive art experience.\n\n> \"All proceeds from the party will support Virginia MOCA’s exhibitions and education programs.\"\n\nFor more information about the farewell events and to purchase tickets for the fundraiser, visit [virginiamoca.org](https://virginiamoca.org/).\n\n## The Move to Virginia Wesleyan\n\nThe Virginia MOCA's move to Virginia Wesleyan University marks a significant step in its evolution. But why the move, and what can we expect from the MOCA in its new home?\n\n### Why the Move?\n\nWhile the Virginia MOCA has thrived at its Parks Avenue location, several factors contributed to the decision to relocate:\n\n*   **Building Repairs and Maintenance:** The existing facility requires significant repairs and maintenance work, estimated at around \\$900,000, according to the city.\n*   **Environmental Constraints:** The Parks Avenue property faces environmental challenges, including being located within a flood hazard zone, containing wetlands, and being near the Chesapeake Bay Resource Protection Area.\n*   **City's Perspective:** The City of Virginia Beach owns the Parks Avenue property and has been exploring alternative uses for the land.\n\n> \"The building needs roughly \\$900,000 in repairs and maintenance work, and the land has significant environmental constraints, according to the city.\"\n\nThe move to Virginia Wesleyan offers the MOCA a custom-built facility with expanded education and exhibition space, allowing it to better serve its mission and the community.\n\n### What's Next for MOCA at Virginia Wesleyan?\n\nThe Virginia MOCA's new home at Virginia Wesleyan University promises exciting opportunities for growth and innovation. The custom-built facility will expand the museum's education and exhibition space by 20%, providing more room to showcase contemporary art and engage with the community.\n\nThe museum is scheduled to open to the public at its new location on April 18th, and the inaugural exhibition will feature the work of contemporary painter Nina Chanel Abney.\n\n## The Future of 2200 Parks Avenue\n\nWith the Virginia MOCA moving to Virginia Wesleyan University, the question arises: what's next for the 9.6-acre property at 2200 Parks Avenue?\n\n### The City's Plans for the Former MOCA Site\n\nThe City of Virginia Beach owns the Parks Avenue property and has been exploring options for its future use. In April, the city issued a request for ideas (RFI) to lease the property, receiving nine proposals. However, in September, the City Council chose to cancel the solicitation and explore other options through an advisory group, according to a city spokesperson.\n\n> \"Last April, the city issued a request for ideas to lease it and received nine proposals.
