Our founders, [Lisa DeNoia](/about/lisa-denoia) and [Jeff Werby](/about/jeff-werby), have spent years building the local ecosystem—most notably through [1701](/1701), Virginia Beach’s first coworking space. We’ve seen firsthand what it takes to go from a \"napkin sketch\" to a thriving storefront.\n+Before diving into paperwork and permits, take the time to thoroughly validate your business idea.

Develop a Solid Business Plan\n \n-Market research is essential for any successful business. It helps you understand potential customers, identify competition, and assess your business idea's viability within a specific area. In Virginia Beach, consider these aspects:\n+A well-crafted business plan is your roadmap to success when learning how to start a business in Virginia Beach. It outlines your business goals, strategies, and how you plan to achieve them. A solid business plan is crucial for securing funding and guiding your business decisions.\n \n-*   **Local Data Sources:** Utilize the \"YesVirginiaBeach\" economic development portal for specific industry clusters and the Hampton Roads Chamber’s regional data.\n-*   **Demographic Trends:** Focus on the growing population of young professionals in the Town Center area and the high concentration of military families near NAS Oceana.\n-*   **Understanding the Local Customer:** Balance your strategy between the 19 million annual visitors at the Oceanfront and the year-round residents in neighborhoods like Great Neck or Pungo.\n-*   **The ViBe Creative District:** This area is a proven incubator for artisan brands; if your business relies on foot traffic and a \"maker\" aesthetic, this is your primary target.\n+*   **Executive Summary:** A brief overview of your business, highlighting key aspects such as your mission, vision, and goals.\n+*   **Company Description:** Provide detailed information about your business, including its structure, ownership, and legal entity.\n+*   **Market Analysis:** Present your findings from market research, including target audience analysis and competitive analysis.\n+*   **Products and Services:** Describe your offerings in detail, highlighting their unique features and benefits.\n+*   **Marketing and Sales Strategy:** Outline how you plan to reach your target audience, promote your business, and generate sales.\n+*   **Management Team:** Introduce your management team and highlight their relevant experience and expertise.\n+*   **Financial Projections:** Develop realistic financial projections, including startup costs, revenue forecasts, and profitability analysis.\n+*   **Funding Request (If Applicable):** If you're seeking funding, clearly state the amount you need and how you plan to use it.\n \n-### Defining Who You Serve\n+The [Arrival proposal](https://arrivalvb.com/proposal), submitted by [Lisa DeNoia](https://arrivalvb.com/about/lisa-denoia) and [Jeff Werby](https://arrivalvb.com/about/jeff-werby) for the former MOCA building at 2200 Parks Avenue, included a comprehensive 85-page proposal with space plans, financials, and partnerships. The $12M projected 5-year revenue reflects their proven track record and community-validated vision. Explore the [Arrival proposal](https://arrivalvb.com/proposal) to see a comprehensive business plan in action.\n \n-Pinpointing your target audience is critical. By understanding your ideal customer, you can tailor your marketing and product offerings to their needs. Consider these factors when identifying your target audience in Virginia Beach:\n+## 3. Choose Your Business Structure\n \n-*   **Leverage Local Data:** Use the City of Virginia Beach’s Open Data portal to find neighborhood-specific income levels and purchasing power.\n-*   **Seasonal Variations:** If you are launching at the Oceanfront, your revenue will likely peak between May and September; ensure your business model can survive the \"off-season\" lull.\n-*   **Tailor to Locals and Visitors:** Successful VB businesses often offer \"local discounts\" or loyalty programs to maintain steady revenue when the tourist crowds dissipate.\n+Selecting the right business structure is a critical decision that impacts your liability, taxes, and administrative requirements. Understanding the different business structures is a key step in opening a business. Common business structures include:\n \n-### Finding Your Competitive Edge\n+*   **Sole Proprietorship:** A simple structure where the business is owned and run by one person. The owner is personally liable for all business debts and obligations.\n+*   **Partnership:** A business owned and run by two or more people. Partners share profits and losses according to their agreement.\n+*   **Limited Liability Company (LLC):** A popular structure that provides liability protection to its owners (members). The business is separate from its owners, shielding their personal assets from business debts and lawsuits.\n+*   **Corporation:** A more complex structure that is legally separate from its owners (shareholders). Corporations offer the strongest liability protection but require more administrative overhead.\n \n-Understanding your competition is essential for differentiating your business and carving out a niche. Analyze existing businesses in Virginia Beach that offer similar products or services:\n+To register your business in Virginia, visit the Virginia State Corporation Commission (SCC): [https://scc.virginia.gov/](https://scc.virginia.gov/)\n \n-*   **Identify Competitors:** Look beyond direct competitors to \"adjacent\" businesses. For example, a new coffee shop isn't just competing with Starbucks; it's competing with every third-space in the ViBe District.\n-*   **Analyze Strengths and Weaknesses:** Visit local competitors in person. Are they missing a digital presence? Is their service slow during the summer rush? These are your opportunities.\n-*   **Unique Selling Proposition (USP):** Your USP should resonate with VB values—think sustainability, military appreciation, or coastal lifestyle.\n-*   **Thriving Industries:** Capitalize on the city's focus on offshore wind energy, biomedical research, and the burgeoning craft beverage scene.\n+## 4. Register Your Business\n \n-## Step 2: Develop a Solid Business Plan\n+Once you've chosen your business structure, you need to register your business with the appropriate government agencies. Registering your business is a crucial step in the process of starting a business in Virginia Beach.\n \n-A well-crafted business plan is your roadmap to success. It outlines your business goals, strategies, and financial projections, providing a clear path as you launch and grow. When we proposed the Arrival concept to the City, we didn't just share a vision; we developed a comprehensive [Full Proposal PDF](/downloads/Arrival-proposal.pdf) with an 85-page breakdown of financials and space utilization. Whether you are seeking a city lease or a private loan, that level of detail is what sets successful founders apart.\n+*   **Virginia State Corporation Commission (SCC):** Register your business entity with the SCC. This is required for LLCs, corporations, and partnerships.\n+*   **\"Doing Business As\" (DBA) Name:** If you're operating under a name different from your legal name, you may need to register a DBA name with the SCC.\n \n-### Summarizing Your Vision\n+## 5. Obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN)\n \n-The executive summary is a brief overview of your entire business plan. It should capture the essence of your business and highlight its potential in Virginia Beach:\n+An Employer Identification Number (EIN) is a unique tax identification number assigned by the IRS. You'll need an EIN if you plan to hire employees or operate as a corporation or partnership. Securing an EIN is essential when considering beginning your venture.\n \n-*   **Local Problem/Solution:** Clearly state the specific Virginia Beach gap your business fills, such as a lack of late-night dining in a specific borough.\n-*   **VB Value Proposition:** Explain why a local resident would choose you over a national chain or a trip to Norfolk.\n-*   **Financial Projections:** Provide a three-year outlook that accounts for local commercial real estate rates and Virginia’s specific labor costs.\n+Apply for an EIN on the IRS website: [https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online)\n \n-### Telling Your Business Story\n+## 6. Secure Funding\n \n-The company description provides a detailed overview of your business, including its structure, mission, and values. Emphasize your commitment to the Virginia Beach community:\n+Starting a business often requires capital. Explore different funding options to secure the necessary resources. Securing funding is a vital component of how to start a business in Virginia Beach.\n \n-*   **Business Structure:** Detail why your choice (like an LLC) protects you while allowing for the specific growth you envision in the Hampton Roads market.\n-*   **Mission and Values:** Align your mission with local priorities, such as environmental stewardship of our waterways or supporting veteran employment.\n-*   **Community Commitment:** Mention specific local initiatives you plan to support, such as Lynnhaven River NOW or the ViBe Creative District non-profit.\n-*   **Potential Partnerships:** List local vendors you intend to use, from VB-based accountants to local suppliers like Fathom Coffee.\n+*   **Personal Savings:** Use your own savings to fund your business.\n+*   **Loans:** Obtain a small business loan from a bank or credit union.\n+*   **Grants:** Apply for grants from government agencies or private organizations.\n+*   **Angel Investors:** Seek funding from angel investors who provide capital in exchange for equity.\n+*   **Venture Capital:** Explore venture capital funding for high-growth potential businesses.\n+*   **Crowdfunding:** Launch a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds from the public.\n \n-## Step 3: Choose Your Business Structure & Register Your Business\n+## 7. Obtain Necessary Licenses and Permits\n \n-Selecting the right business structure is crucial for legal and financial reasons. It impacts your liability, taxes, and administrative requirements. \n+Operating a business in Virginia Beach requires obtaining the necessary licenses and permits from the city and state. Navigating licenses and permits is a key step in establishing a business.\n \n-> ### Founder’s Insight: The \"Werby Tracker\" Mentality\n-> When [Jeff Werby](/about/jeff-werby) was proving the need for a CRM at ADS, he didn't wait for a massive corporate budget. He built the **\"Werby Tracker\"**—a scrappy, custom prototype that logged **20,000 activities in three months**. \n-> \n-> We apply this same **\"Track Record of Action\"** to business structures:\n-> *   **Don't over-engineer:** Avoid complex corporations if a simple LLC allows you to start testing today.\n-> *   **Build proof of concept first:** Get your idea in front of customers before spending thousands on legal fees.\n-> *   **Scale the framework:** Match your legal structure to your actual success, not your hypothetical future.\n+*   **Business License:** Obtain a business license from the City of Virginia Beach. This license allows you to legally operate your business within the city.\n+    *   Visit the City of Virginia Beach business license portal for more information: [https://www.vbgov.com/government/departments/city-treasurer/business-license/Pages/default.aspx](https://www.vbgov.com/government/departments/city-treasurer/business-license/Pages/default.aspx)\n+*   **Zoning Permit:** Ensure your business location complies with city zoning regulations. Contact the Virginia Beach Planning Department for zoning information.\n+    *   Virginia Beach Planning Department: [https://www.vbgov.com/government/departments/planning/Pages/default.aspx](https://www.vbgov.com/government/departments/planning/Pages/default.aspx)\n+*   **Other Permits:** Depending on your industry, you may need additional permits, such as health permits, building permits, or alcohol licenses.\n \n-### Choosing Your Legal Foundation\n+## 8. Choose a Business Location\n \n-Choosing the right business structure is a critical decision with significant legal and financial implications. Here's an overview of the most common business structures:\n+The location of your business can significantly impact its success. Consider factors such as accessibility and visibility when learning how to start a business in Virginia Beach.\n \n-*   **Sole Proprietorship:** The most common path for VB freelancers, but remember that your personal assets are tied to the business—a risk in a litigious market.\n-*   **Partnership:** Ideal for co-founded ventures, but requires a clear operating agreement to prevent disputes as the business scales.\n-*   **Limited Liability Company (LLC):** The \"gold standard\" for most Virginia Beach startups, offering a balance of liability protection and tax flexibility.\n-*   **Corporation:** Necessary if you plan to seek venture capital from groups like 757 Angels or eventually go public.\n+*   **Accessibility:** Choose a location that is easily accessible to your target audience.\n+*   **Visibility:** Select a location with high visibility and foot traffic.\n+*   **Cost:** Balance your location needs with your budget.\n+*   **Zoning:** Ensure your business type is permitted in the chosen zoning district.\n \n-### Making Your Name Official\n+The [Arrival proposal](https://arrivalvb.com/proposal) focused on the former MOCA building at 2200 Parks Avenue, highlighting the importance of the location at the gateway to the Oceanfront Resort District and its adjacency to the ViBe Creative District. Discover more about the strategic location of the [Arrival proposal](https://arrivalvb.com/proposal).\n \n-Registering your business name is essential for establishing your legal identity and protecting your brand. Here's how to register your business name in Virginia Beach:\n+## 9. Set Up Your Business Finances\n \n-*   **Check Availability:** Use the Virginia SCC online search tool to ensure your name isn't already claimed by a business in Richmond or Norfolk.\n-*   **File with the SCC:** Most Virginia entities must file Articles of Organization through the Clerk's Information System (CIS).\n-*   **DBA (Doing Business As):** If you are a sole proprietor using a creative name, you must file a \"Fictitious Name\" certificate with the Clerk of the Circuit Court in Virginia Beach.\n+Proper financial management is essential for long-term success. Setting up your business finances is a critical step for any new entrepreneur in the region.\n \n-## Step 4: Secure the Necessary Licenses and Permits\n+*   **Open a Business Bank Account:** Keep your personal and business finances separate by opening a dedicated business bank account.\n+*   **Accounting Software:** Implement accounting software to track your income, expenses, and financial performance.\n+*   **Bookkeeping:** Maintain accurate and up-to-date financial records.\n \n-Operating legally requires obtaining the right licenses and permits, which vary depending on your business type and location. \n+## 10. Market Your Business\n \n-> ### Founder’s Insight: Navigating the Gateway\n-> Virginia Beach has specific **\"overlay districts,\"** like the Resort Area, which have stricter rules for signage and outdoor seating. When we were planning Arrival for the gateway of the Oceanfront, we learned that:\n-> *   **Compliance is strategic:** It’s about understanding the city's long-term vision for that specific block.\n-> *   **Talk to Planning early:** The department would rather help you get it right now than fine you later.\n-> *   **Check your signage:** Rules in the ViBe or Resort districts are much more specific than in other parts of the city.\n+Effective marketing is crucial for attracting customers and generating revenue. Marketing your business effectively is essential when learning how to start a business in Virginia Beach.\n \n-### Navigating Local Compliance\n+*   **Develop a Brand Identity:** Create a unique brand identity that reflects your business values and resonates with your target audience.\n+*   **Build a Website:** Establish an online presence with a professional website.\n+*   **Social Media Marketing:** Utilize social media platforms to engage with your target audience, build brand awareness, and drive traffic to your website.\n+*   **Content Marketing:** Create valuable and informative content, such as blog posts, articles, and videos, to attract and engage your target audience.\n+*   **Search Engine Optimization (SEO):** Optimize your website and content for search engines to improve your visibility in search results.\n+*   **Local Advertising:** Consider local advertising options, such as print ads, radio ads, and community sponsorships.\n \n-A business license is a permit issued by the City of Virginia Beach that allows you to operate within city limits.\n+## 11. Network and Seek Support\n \n-*   **General Requirements:** You must apply for a Business Professional and Occupational License (BPOL) through the Commissioner of the Revenue within 30 days of starting.\n-*   **Online Application:** The city’s \"Business License Application\" portal is the starting point for all new ventures.\n-*   **Specific Requirements:** Home-based businesses in VB require a \"Home Occupation Permit\" to ensure you aren't violating neighborhood traffic or noise ordinances.\n+Connecting with other entrepreneurs and seeking support from local organizations can be invaluable. Networking and seeking support are vital aspects of growing a business in Virginia Beach.\n \n-### Industry-Specific Licenses and Permits\n+*   **Hampton Roads Chamber of Commerce:** Join the Hampton Roads Chamber of Commerce to network with other business professionals and access valuable resources.\n+    *   Hampton Roads Chamber: [https://www.hrchamber.com/](https://www.hrchamber.com/)\n+*   **Small Business Administration (SBA):** Utilize the resources and programs offered by the SBA to support your business.\n+    *   SBA: [https://www.sba.gov/](https://www.sba.gov/)\n+*   **Virginia Beach Department of Economic Development:** Contact the Virginia Beach Department of Economic Development for assistance with business planning, financing, and site selection.\n \n-In addition to a general business license and zoning permits, you may need industry-specific licenses and permits depending on your business.\n+## 12. Embrace the Virginia Beach Community\n \n-*   **Food Handling Permit:** Essential for any VB eatery; requires an inspection from the Virginia Beach Health Department on Viking Drive.\n-*   **Alcohol License:** If serving at the Oceanfront, be prepared for a rigorous application process with the Virginia ABC.\n-*   **Contractor's License:** Required for any home improvement or construction business through the DPOR in Richmond.\n+Virginia Beach has incredible talent, and the best way to succeed is to embrace the community. Support local businesses, participate in local events, and build relationships with other entrepreneurs. Engaging with the Virginia Beach community is key to long-term success.

Virginia Beach offers resources to support entrepreneurs, from funding to mentorship. Our founders have spent a decade navigating these waters; you can learn more about their track record in our [Founder Bios](/about).\n-\n-### Leveraging Local Support Networks\n-\n-*   **Small Business Development Center (SBDC) of Hampton Roads:** Offers free, one-on-one counseling for VB founders.\n-*   **Hampton Roads Chamber of Commerce:** A vital networking hub that awarded [Lisa DeNoia](/about/lisa-denoia) Entrepreneur of the Year in 2018.\n-*   **Virginia Beach Department of Economic Development:** Focuses on business retention and expansion within the city.\n-*   **SCORE Hampton Roads:** Connects you with retired executives who have \"been there, done that\" in the local market.\n-\n-### The Value of Coworking Spaces for Startups\n-\n-Coworking spaces offer many benefits for startups, providing a supportive and collaborative environment that can foster growth and innovation. During our seven years running [1701](/1701), we helped over 40 businesses graduate from a single desk to their own dedicated office spaces.

Effective marketing is essential for attracting customers and building brand awareness. \n-\n-### Local SEO Strategies\n-\n-Local SEO is important for attracting customers in Virginia Beach.\n-\n-*   **Optimize Website:** Ensure your Google Business Profile is claimed and specifically mentions your Virginia Beach neighborhood (e.g., \"Best Pizza in Chic’s Beach\").\n-\n-### Engaging the Community Online\n-\n-Use social media to reach potential customers in Virginia Beach.\n-\n-*   **Engaging Content:** Join local Facebook groups like \"Virginia Beach Small Business\" to network and share updates.\n-\n-## Step 8: Ongoing Compliance and Growth\n-\n-Staying compliant with regulations and planning for growth are essential for long-term success. \n-\n-### Staying Compliant with Local Taxes\n-\n-Understand the tax obligations for businesses in Virginia Beach.\n-\n-*   **Tax Resources:** The Commissioner of the Revenue’s office is surprisingly helpful—don't be afraid to call them with questions about your BPOL or personal property taxes.\n-\n ## Conclusion\n \n-Starting a business in Virginia Beach is an exciting journey filled with opportunities and challenges.

Opportunities abound, from the vibrant ViBe Creative District to the bustling Oceanfront. However, starting a business can feel overwhelming. This guide simplifies the process, providing the local knowledge and resources needed to launch successfully in Virginia Beach. \n\nAt Arrival, we're committed to supporting the Virginia Beach community and its aspiring business owners. Our founders, [Lisa DeNoia](/about/lisa-denoia) and [Jeff Werby](/about/jeff-werby), have spent years building the local ecosystem—most notably through [1701](/1701), Virginia Beach’s first coworking space. We’ve seen firsthand what it takes to go from a \"napkin sketch\" to a thriving storefront.\n\n## Step 1: Validate Your Business Idea\n\nBefore diving into entrepreneurship, ensure there's a market for your product or service *in Virginia Beach*. When we ran [1701](/1701), we often saw founders rush into a lease before testing their concept. The most successful businesses we hosted were those that spent time talking to locals at the ViBe Old Beach Farmers Market or testing their services with a small pilot group first.\n\n### Understanding the Local Landscape\n\nMarket research is essential for any successful business. It helps you understand potential customers, identify competition, and assess your business idea's viability within a specific area. In Virginia Beach, consider these aspects:\n\n*   **Local Data Sources:** Utilize the \"YesVirginiaBeach\" economic development portal for specific industry clusters and the Hampton Roads Chamber’s regional data.\n*   **Demographic Trends:** Focus on the growing population of young professionals in the Town Center area and the high concentration of military families near NAS Oceana.\n*   **Understanding the Local Customer:** Balance your strategy between the 19 million annual visitors at the Oceanfront and the year-round residents in neighborhoods like Great Neck or Pungo.\n*   **The ViBe Creative District:** This area is a proven incubator for artisan brands; if your business relies on foot traffic and a \"maker\" aesthetic, this is your primary target.\n\n### Defining Who You Serve\n\nPinpointing your target audience is critical. By understanding your ideal customer, you can tailor your marketing and product offerings to their needs. Consider these factors when identifying your target audience in Virginia Beach:\n\n*   **Leverage Local Data:** Use the City of Virginia Beach’s Open Data portal to find neighborhood-specific income levels and purchasing power.\n*   **Seasonal Variations:** If you are launching at the Oceanfront, your revenue will likely peak between May and September; ensure your business model can survive the \"off-season\" lull.\n*   **Tailor to Locals and Visitors:** Successful VB businesses often offer \"local discounts\" or loyalty programs to maintain steady revenue when the tourist crowds dissipate.\n\n### Finding Your Competitive Edge\n\nUnderstanding your competition is essential for differentiating your business and carving out a niche. Analyze existing businesses in Virginia Beach that offer similar products or services:\n\n*   **Identify Competitors:** Look beyond direct competitors to \"adjacent\" businesses. For example, a new coffee shop isn't just competing with Starbucks; it's competing with every third-space in the ViBe District.\n*   **Analyze Strengths and Weaknesses:** Visit local competitors in person. Are they missing a digital presence? Is their service slow during the summer rush? These are your opportunities.\n*   **Unique Selling Proposition (USP):** Your USP should resonate with VB values—think sustainability, military appreciation, or coastal lifestyle.\n*   **Thriving Industries:** Capitalize on the city's focus on offshore wind energy, biomedical research, and the burgeoning craft beverage scene.\n\n## Step 2: Develop a Solid Business Plan\n\nA well-crafted business plan is your roadmap to success. It outlines your business goals, strategies, and financial projections, providing a clear path as you launch and grow. When we proposed the Arrival concept to the City, we didn't just share a vision; we developed a comprehensive [Full Proposal PDF](/downloads/Arrival-proposal.pdf) with an 85-page breakdown of financials and space utilization. Whether you are seeking a city lease or a private loan, that level of detail is what sets successful founders apart.\n\n### Summarizing Your Vision\n\nThe executive summary is a brief overview of your entire business plan. It should capture the essence of your business and highlight its potential in Virginia Beach:\n\n*   **Local Problem/Solution:** Clearly state the specific Virginia Beach gap your business fills, such as a lack of late-night dining in a specific borough.\n*   **VB Value Proposition:** Explain why a local resident would choose you over a national chain or a trip to Norfolk.\n*   **Financial Projections:** Provide a three-year outlook that accounts for local commercial real estate rates and Virginia’s specific labor costs.\n\n### Telling Your Business Story\n\nThe company description provides a detailed overview of your business, including its structure, mission, and values. Emphasize your commitment to the Virginia Beach community:\n\n*   **Business Structure:** Detail why your choice (like an LLC) protects you while allowing for the specific growth you envision in the Hampton Roads market.\n*   **Mission and Values:** Align your mission with local priorities, such as environmental stewardship of our waterways or supporting veteran employment.\n*   **Community Commitment:** Mention specific local initiatives you plan to support, such as Lynnhaven River NOW or the ViBe Creative District non-profit.\n*   **Potential Partnerships:** List local vendors you intend to use, from VB-based accountants to local suppliers like Fathom Coffee.\n\n## Step 3: Choose Your Business Structure & Register Your Business\n\nSelecting the right business structure is crucial for legal and financial reasons. It impacts your liability, taxes, and administrative requirements. \n\n> ### Founder’s Insight: The \"Werby Tracker\" Mentality\n> When [Jeff Werby](/about/jeff-werby) was proving the need for a CRM at ADS, he didn't wait for a massive corporate budget. He built the \"Werby Tracker\"—a scrappy, custom prototype that logged 20,000 activities in three months. We apply this same \"Track Record of Action\" to business structures. Don't over-engineer a complex corporation if a simple LLC allows you to start testing your market today. Build the proof of concept first, then scale the legal framework to match your success.\n\n### Choosing Your Legal Foundation\n\nChoosing the right business structure is a critical decision with significant legal and financial implications. Here's an overview of the most common business structures:\n\n*   **Sole Proprietorship:** The most common path for VB freelancers, but remember that your personal assets are tied to the business—a risk in a litigious market.\n*   **Partnership:** Ideal for co-founded ventures, but requires a clear operating agreement to prevent disputes as the business scales.\n*   **Limited Liability Company (LLC):** The \"gold standard\" for most Virginia Beach startups, offering a balance of liability protection and tax flexibility.\n*   **Corporation:** Necessary if you plan to seek venture capital from groups like 757 Angels or eventually go public.\n\n### Making Your Name Official\n\nRegistering your business name is essential for establishing your legal identity and protecting your brand. Here's how to register your business name in Virginia Beach:\n\n*   **Check Availability:** Use the Virginia SCC online search tool to ensure your name isn't already claimed by a business in Richmond or Norfolk.\n*   **File with the SCC:** Most Virginia entities must file Articles of Organization through the Clerk's Information System (CIS).\n*   **DBA (Doing Business As):** If you are a sole proprietor using a creative name, you must file a \"Fictitious Name\" certificate with the Clerk of the Circuit Court in Virginia Beach.\n\n## Step 4: Secure the Necessary Licenses and Permits\n\nOperating legally requires obtaining the right licenses and permits, which vary depending on your business type and location. \n\n> ### Founder’s Insight: Navigating the Gateway\n> Virginia Beach has specific \"overlay districts,\" like the Resort Area, which have stricter rules for signage and outdoor seating. When we were planning Arrival for the gateway of the Oceanfront, we realized that compliance isn't just about a piece of paper—it's about understanding the city's long-term vision for that specific block. Always talk to the Planning Department early; they would rather help you get it right now than fine you later.\n\n### Navigating Local Compliance\n\nA business license is a permit issued by the City of Virginia Beach that allows you to operate within city limits.\n\n*   **General Requirements:** You must apply for a Business Professional and Occupational License (BPOL) through the Commissioner of the Revenue within 30 days of starting.\n*   **Online Application:** The city’s \"Business License Application\" portal is the starting point for all new ventures.\n*   **Specific Requirements:** Home-based businesses in VB require a \"Home Occupation Permit\" to ensure you aren't violating neighborhood traffic or noise ordinances.\n\n### Industry-Specific Licenses and Permits\n\nIn addition to a general business license and zoning permits, you may need industry-specific licenses and permits depending on your business.\n\n*   **Food Handling Permit:** Essential for any VB eatery; requires an inspection from the Virginia Beach Health Department on Viking Drive.\n*   **Alcohol License:** If serving at the Oceanfront, be prepared for a rigorous application process with the Virginia ABC.\n*   **Contractor's License:** Required for any home improvement or construction business through the DPOR in Richmond.\n\n## Step 5: Find Funding and Resources\n\nDon't go it alone! Virginia Beach offers resources to support entrepreneurs, from funding to mentorship. Our founders have spent a decade navigating these waters; you can learn more about their track record in our [Founder Bios](/about).\n\n### Leveraging Local Support Networks\n\n*   **Small Business Development Center (SBDC) of Hampton Roads:** Offers free, one-on-one counseling for VB founders.\n*   **Hampton Roads Chamber of Commerce:** A vital networking hub that awarded [Lisa DeNoia](/about/lisa-denoia) Entrepreneur of the Year in 2018.\n*   **Virginia Beach Department of Economic Development:** Focuses on business retention and expansion within the city.\n*   **SCORE Hampton Roads:** Connects you with retired executives who have \"been there, done that\" in the local market.\n\n### The Value of Coworking Spaces for Startups\n\nCoworking spaces offer many benefits for startups, providing a supportive and collaborative environment that can foster growth and innovation. During our seven years running [1701](/1701), we helped over 40 businesses graduate from a single desk to their own dedicated office spaces. That transition is where most businesses fail, but the built-in community of a coworking space provides the safety net needed to scale.\n\nAt Arrival, we envision a community-centered coworking space that goes beyond desks. We aim to create a vibrant ecosystem where entrepreneurs can thrive, connect, and build their dreams in Virginia Beach. Arrival is committed to supporting local entrepreneurs and fostering innovation. \n\n## Step 6: Set Up Your Business Operations\n\nFrom choosing a location to managing your finances, this section covers the essential operational aspects of running your business in Virginia Beach.\n\n> ### Founder’s Insight: The Graduation Story\n> One of our favorite [1701](/1701) memories is a creative agency that started with just two people at a shared table. They used our conference rooms to land their first major city contract, grew to five people, and eventually \"graduated\" to their own storefront in the ViBe District. That’s the goal: using shared resources to build enough momentum to become a permanent fixture in the Virginia Beach landscape.\n\n### Finding the Right Place to Work\n\nYour business's location can significantly impact its success. Consider these factors when choosing a location in Virginia Beach:\n\n*   **Office Space:** Look for \"Class A\" space in Town Center if you need corporate prestige, or creative \"flex\" space in the ViBe District for a more modern vibe.\n*   **Retail Space:** Prioritize Shore Drive or Hilltop for high-income local traffic, or the Atlantic Avenue corridor for maximum tourist exposure.\n*   **Home-Based Business:** Virginia Beach is very supportive of home offices, provided you don't have clients visiting in a way that disrupts residential parking.\n\n### Managing Your Money Effectively\n\nProper financial management is essential for any business.\n\n*   **Business Bank Account:** Local banks like TowneBank or Atlantic Union have deep roots in the VB business community and offer more personalized service than national giants.\n*   **Accounting Software:** Use a cloud-based system like QuickBooks to ensure you are ready for Virginia’s quarterly sales tax filings.\n*   **Bookkeeping:** Keep meticulous records of your \"Business Tangible Personal Property\"—Virginia Beach taxes the equipment and furniture used in your business annually.\n\n## Step 7: Market Your Business\n\nGet the word out! Effective marketing is essential for attracting customers and building brand awareness. \n\n### Local SEO Strategies\n\nLocal SEO is important for attracting customers in Virginia Beach.\n\n*   **Optimize Website:** Ensure your Google Business Profile is claimed and specifically mentions your Virginia Beach neighborhood (e.g., \"Best Pizza in Chic’s Beach\").\n\n### Engaging the Community Online\n\nUse social media to reach potential customers in Virginia Beach.\n\n*   **Engaging Content:** Join local Facebook groups like \"Virginia Beach Small Business\" to network and share updates.\n\n## Step 8: Ongoing Compliance and Growth\n\nStaying compliant with regulations and planning for growth are essential for long-term success. \n\n### Staying Compliant with Local Taxes\n\nUnderstand the tax obligations for businesses in Virginia Beach.\n\n*   **Tax Resources:** The Commissioner of the Revenue’s office is surprisingly helpful—don't be afraid to call them with questions about your BPOL or personal property taxes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nStarting a business in Virginia Beach is an exciting journey filled with opportunities and challenges. By following these steps, conducting thorough research, and leveraging local resources, you can increase your chances of success. Remember to validate your idea, develop a solid business plan, secure the necessary licenses and permits, and actively market your business within the community.\n\nAt Arrival, we are passionate about fostering a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem in Virginia Beach.
