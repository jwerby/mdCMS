VIRGINIA BEACH — So long, farewell. Virginia Museum of Contemporary Art is saying goodbye to its current location on Parks Avenue at the Oceanfront and preparing to move to its new home on the campus of Virginia Wesleyan University.  But before the doors close, Virginia MOCA will host a fundraiser on Jan. 10 and a daylong free community farewell event on Jan. 11.  A fundraiser will begin at 6 p.m. Jan. 10 with art, food, beverages and live music. Guests will be able to look inside the museum’s vault to view decades of the Boardwalk Art Show’s best-in-show artworks that will be available through a silent auction.  The community event will be held from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Jan. 11. It will feature art demos and artist pop-up talks as well as Doodlefest, an interactive art experience.  All proceeds from the party will support Virginia MOCA’s exhibitions and education programs.  The museum will remain open in its current location through Jan. 11, according to spokesperson Linda Koller. It will open to the public at Virginia Wesleyan University on April 18. Contemporary painter Nina Chanel Abney’s work will be exhibited in the new building this spring.  In 2023, Virginia MOCA announced plans to move from its home at 2200 Parks Ave., near the Virginia Beach Convention Center, to a custom-built facility on the Virginia Wesleyan University campus. Work began on the new site off Smith Drive last fall. Local philanthropists Jane Batten, Joan Brock, and Susan and David Goode donated $25 million for construction of the new building, The Pilot has reported. The new building will expand the museum’s education and exhibition space by 20%.  The city of Virginia Beach owns the Parks Avenue property and has leased it to the museum since 1986. It consists of 9.6 acres of land, a 38,000-square-foot building and approximately 100 surface spaces.  The building needs roughly $900,000 in repairs and maintenance work, and the land has significant environmental constraints, according to the city. Nearly the entire property is within a flood hazard zone, approximately 3 acres contains wetlands and another 3.5 acres are within 100-feet of the Chesapeake Bay Resource Protection Area.  Last April, the city issued a request for ideas to lease it and received nine proposals. But in September, the City Council chose to cancel the solicitation and explore other options through an advisory group, according to a city spokesperson.
