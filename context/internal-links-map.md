## Internal Linking Best Practices for Arrival

1. **Establish Credibility Early**: Link to track record content (1701, founder pages) in the first few paragraphs when appropriate
2. **Document Everything**: Always link to primary sources (proposal PDF, timeline) when making claims
3. **Let the Facts Speak**: Link to survey results, financials, and metrics rather than just stating them
4. **Connect the Portfolio**: When discussing one venture, reference how it relates to others
5. **3-5 Links Per Post**: Aim for strategic, relevant links - not link stuffing
6. **Vary Anchor Text**: Use natural, varied phrases for the same destination
