# Arrival Brand Voice & Messaging

This document defines the Arrival brand voice, tone, and messaging framework. Reference this when writing all content to ensure consistency.

## Brand Voice Pillars

### 1. Community-Centered
- **What it means**: Everything we do is rooted in serving Virginia Beach's entrepreneurs, artists, and innovators. We're not building for ourselves - we're building for the community.
- **How it sounds**: Inclusive, welcoming, focused on collective benefit rather than personal gain. We use "we" and "our community" frequently.
- **Example**: "When 1701 opened its doors, we weren't just creating a workspace - we were creating a home for Virginia Beach's dreamers, makers, and builders."
- **Avoid**: Self-promotion that doesn't connect to community benefit; exclusive or elitist language; corporate speak

### 2. Track Record of Action
- **What it means**: We've done this before. We built 1701 from nothing, supported hundreds of businesses, and created real economic impact. We speak from experience, not theory.
- **How it sounds**: Confident but not boastful; specific with examples and outcomes; grounded in real stories and data
- **Example**: "In five years at 1701, we hosted over 300 events, supported dozens of startups, and became the gathering place for Virginia Beach's entrepreneurial community."
- **Avoid**: Vague claims without evidence; theoretical language without real-world examples; overpromising

### 3. Transparent & Direct
- **What it means**: We tell the truth about what happened, what we proposed, and what we're trying to achieve. No spin, no corporate doublespeak.
- **How it sounds**: Clear, factual, straightforward. When we don't know something, we say so. When something is frustrating, we acknowledge it honestly.
- **Example**: "After being selected for an interview, we were informed that the City had canceled the RFI entirely. We still don't have clear answers about why."
- **Avoid**: Evasive language; blame without facts; emotional venting; conspiracy theories

### 4. Visionary but Practical
- **What it means**: We have a bold vision for what Virginia Beach could be, but we also have the business plans, partnerships, and experience to make it real.
- **How it sounds**: Aspirational paired with specifics; big ideas backed by concrete details; inspiring without being naive
- **Example**: "Arrival would bring together coworking, arts, culinary innovation, and community events under one roof - and we have the $12M five-year business plan to prove it's viable."
- **Avoid**: Pie-in-the-sky language without substance; pessimism; excessive jargon

### 5. Virginia Beach Pride
- **What it means**: We love this city and believe it deserves world-class infrastructure for innovation and culture. We're not trying to make it like somewhere else - we want to make it the best version of itself.
- **How it sounds**: Local knowledge and pride; references to specific Virginia Beach places, people, and culture; forward-looking optimism about the region
- **Example**: "Virginia Beach has incredible talent, but too often we lose it to DC, Richmond, or beyond. Arrival would give innovators a reason to stay and build here."
- **Avoid**: Negativity about Virginia Beach; comparisons that diminish the city; insider references that exclude newcomers

## Tone Guidelines

### General Tone: Credible Community Advocates
Imagine you're experienced community builders who deeply love Virginia Beach, have already proven what's possible with 1701, and are now trying to take that model to the next level. You're frustrated that the RFI process ended the way it did, but you're channeling that into transparency and continued advocacy rather than bitterness.

### Tone Variations by Content Type

**Project Documentation (Proposal, Timeline, Process)**:
Factual, transparent, detailed
- "Here's what we proposed and why we believe it would work."
- "The timeline of events speaks for itself."
- "We've made all our documentation public so you can judge for yourself."

**1701 Legacy Content**:
Warm, proud, grateful
- "1701 wasn't just a business - it was a community."
- "We're still in touch with entrepreneurs who got their start at 1701."
- "What we learned at 1701 shaped everything about the Arrival concept."

**Vision/Future Content**:
Optimistic, inviting, action-oriented
- "Virginia Beach deserves a place where innovation and creativity collide."
- "We're looking for partners who share this vision."
- "The concept is ready - now we need the opportunity."

**Commentary/Analysis**:
Thoughtful, measured, factual
- "Here's what we know and what we're still trying to understand."
- "The community survey showed 86% support - that's not nothing."
- "We believe in civic processes, and we want to understand what happened here."

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Sentence Structure
- **Vary length**: Mix short declarative sentences with longer explanatory ones
- **Active voice preferred**: "We built 1701" not "1701 was built by us"
- **Average length**: 15-25 words per sentence
- **Clarity first**: If a sentence needs to be re-read, it needs to be rewritten

### Paragraph Structure
- **Length**: 3-5 sentences typically
- **One idea per paragraph**: Don't try to cover too much ground at once
- **Transitions**: Connect paragraphs logically; avoid jarring topic shifts
- **White space**: Use headers and breaks generously for readability

### Word Choice
- **Conversational but credible**: Write like you'd speak to a city council member
- **Specific**: "86% approval" not "overwhelming support"; "$12M over 5 years" not "significant revenue"
- **Active verbs**: "built", "created", "hosted", "supported", "proposed"
- **Avoid fluff**: Cut unnecessary qualifiers and filler words

### Terminology

**Say This** -> **Not That**
- "community hub" -> "facility" (more warm and purposeful)
- "Virginia Beach" -> "VB" (use full name for clarity and SEO)
- "coworking" -> "shared office space" (industry-standard term)
- "the proposal" -> "our submission" (clearer reference)
- "the RFI was canceled" -> "we lost" (factually accurate framing)

## Content Formatting

### Headlines
- **Be specific**: "What We Proposed for 2200 Parks Avenue" not "Our Proposal"
- **Include benefit or intrigue**: Tell reader why they should care
- **Keep concise**: 60 characters or less for SEO

### Subheadings
- **Guide the reader**: Subheadings should tell the story even if someone just skims
- **Use questions when appropriate**: "Why did the RFI get canceled?"
- **Be descriptive**: "Our Five-Year Financial Model" not "Financials"

### Lists
- **Use for scannability**: Lists help readers find key information quickly
- **Parallel structure**: Start each item the same way grammatically
- **Include context**: Don't assume readers understand list items without explanation

### Calls-to-Action
- **Be clear about next steps**: "Read the full proposal" / "Contact us about partnership opportunities"
- **Don't oversell**: We're building awareness, not closing deals
- **Include email/contact for serious inquiries**

## Voice Examples

### Excellent Arrival Voice

"When we opened 1701 in the ViBe Creative District, people told us Virginia Beach wasn't ready for a coworking space. Seven years and hundreds of members later, we'd proven them wrong. 1701 became the gathering place for entrepreneurs, freelancers, and remote workers who wanted to build something here instead of leaving for bigger cities.

That experience taught us what Virginia Beach needs: not just workspace, but a true community hub - a place where innovation, creativity, and connection happen under one roof. When the City released an RFI for the former MOCA building at 2200 Parks Avenue, we saw the perfect opportunity to bring that vision to life.

We submitted an 85-page proposal. We conducted a community survey that showed 86% support. We assembled a board of 16 community leaders. We were invited to interview with the City. And then, without clear explanation, the RFI was canceled.

We're making our full proposal public because we believe the community deserves to see what was on the table."

**Why this works**:
- Establishes credibility through 1701 story
- Shows vision connected to community need
- Presents facts about the RFI process directly
- Doesn't blame or complain, just documents
- Ends with transparency commitment

### Not Arrival Voice

"We are extremely excited to announce our groundbreaking initiative to revolutionize the Virginia Beach community space landscape! Our world-class team of visionary leaders has developed a best-in-class solution for the 2200 Parks Avenue opportunity. Unfortunately, due to bureaucratic red tape and a lack of vision from city leadership, this amazing project has been put on hold. We demand answers and urge all stakeholders to contact their representatives immediately!"

**Why this fails**:
- Corporate buzzwords ("groundbreaking", "world-class", "best-in-class")
- Finger-pointing and blame
- Emotional/activist tone that undermines credibility
- No specific facts or documentation
- Tells people what to do rather than informing them
