# How We Built Virginia Beach's First Coworking Space

In 2016, Virginia Beach didn't have a coworking space. That might be hard to believe now, but when we opened 1701 in the ViBe Creative District, we were told it wouldn't work here. "Virginia Beach isn't that kind of city," people said. "People here commute to Norfolk or work from home."

We opened anyway.

## Why We Started 1701

The idea came from frustration. We'd both worked in corporate environments and knew firsthand how isolating it could be to build something on your own. Lisa had spent years in technology and government contracting, watching talented people leave Hampton Roads for opportunities in DC or Richmond. Jeff had seen the same pattern after his Navy service and time at Amazon - smart, capable people who wanted to stay in Virginia Beach but couldn't find the infrastructure to support their ambitions.

We wanted to create a place where entrepreneurs, freelancers, and remote workers could find community. Not just desks - community.

## What 1701 Became

Over seven years, 1701 evolved from an experiment into the gathering place for Virginia Beach's entrepreneurial ecosystem.

The numbers tell part of the story:
- **750+ businesses** came through our doors
- **40+ businesses** grew enough to graduate to their own dedicated office space
- **300+ events** brought the community together
- **7 years** of continuous operation in the ViBe Creative District

But numbers don't capture what 1701 really was. It was the coffee conversations that turned into partnerships. The pitch practice sessions before big meetings. The late nights when someone needed to vent about a difficult client, and there was always someone who understood.

## What We Learned

Running 1701 taught us things you can't learn from business books.

We learned that community spaces need programming, not just square footage. A room with desks isn't a coworking space - it's a room with desks. What makes it work is the events, the introductions, the culture you intentionally build.

We learned that entrepreneurs need different things at different stages. A solo founder working on their first product needs something different than a team of five preparing to raise their Series A. Flexibility isn't a feature - it's the foundation.

We learned that Virginia Beach has incredible talent. The people who told us it wouldn't work here were wrong. The demand was always there. What was missing was the infrastructure.

## Why 1701 Closed

After seven successful years, we made the difficult decision to close 1701. The reasons were practical - the building had other plans, and we had other opportunities to pursue. But closing 1701 didn't mean closing the chapter on what we'd learned or the community we'd built.

If anything, it clarified our vision for what comes next.

## What Comes Next

The connections made at 1701 continue to shape Virginia Beach's business community. We still hear from entrepreneurs who got their start at our tables. The 40+ businesses that graduated to their own spaces are still growing. The ecosystem we helped build is still here.

And we're still here, with everything we learned and a vision for something even bigger.

When we heard the City was looking for proposals for the former MOCA building at 2200 Parks Avenue, we saw the opportunity to bring everything 1701 taught us to a new scale. A place where coworking, arts, culinary innovation, and community events could happen under one roof.

We called it Arrival.

# What We Proposed for 2200 Parks Avenue

In June 2024, the City of Virginia Beach released RFI #ED-25-01, seeking proposals for the former MOCA building at 2200 Parks Avenue. We submitted a comprehensive 85-page proposal for a concept we called Arrival.

Here's what we proposed, and what happened.

## The Arrival Concept

Arrival was designed as a "Metroburb" - an urban hub within suburbia, inspired by the successful Bell Works development in New Jersey. The concept would transform the 37,829-square-foot building and 9.6-acre property into a synergistic ecosystem of innovation, arts, and community.

### Core Components

**Innovation & Coworking Center**: Flexible workspace for entrepreneurs, remote workers, and small businesses. We'd proven this model works in Virginia Beach with 1701 - seven years of operation, 750+ businesses served, 40+ graduating to their own spaces.

**Arts and Cultural Galleries**: Exhibition space for visual arts, rotating shows, and cultural programming. We partnered with Creative Well Arts Foundation to ensure quality curation and community access.

**Culinary Incubator & Cafe**: Commercial kitchen for food entrepreneurs plus a public cafe. Partners included The Crop Foundation for food/agriculture programming.

**Events and Performance Venue**: The existing 300-seat auditorium would host concerts, film screenings, lectures, and pitch nights. In our community survey, live events ranked #1 in demand at 68.3%.

**Wellness Studio**: Flexible space for fitness classes, yoga, and meditation, partnered with Oasis Health Group.

**Botanical Garden**: Working with Lynnhaven River NOW to create sustainable landscapes connecting the interior to the 9.6-acre grounds.

## The Business Model

We didn't propose a wish list - we proposed a viable business.

**Projected Revenue**:
- Year 1: $725,000
- Year 3: $3.3M
- 5-Year Total: $12.04M

**Revenue Mix**:
- Events & Venue Rentals: 25.1%
- Coworking: 22.9%
- Social Memberships: 11.3%
- Sponsorships & Grants: 10.0%
- Food & Beverage: 10.0%
- Cultural Programming: 9.3%
- Education & Training: 7.6%

This wasn't theoretical. It was based on our experience operating 1701 for seven years and Port & Starboard's work with economic development agencies.

## Community Validation

Before submitting, we surveyed the community. In just 15 days, we received 100+ responses.

**The results**:
- 86.1% said they were "Very Likely" or "Somewhat Likely" to visit or use Arrival
- Only 1% said "Unlikely"

The top requested services aligned exactly with our proposal: live events (68.3%), coworking (66.3%), outdoor events (57%), art galleries (56.4%), and culinary programming (55%).

## Our Team

We assembled a board of 16+ community leaders and secured commitments from partner organizations including:
- Lynnhaven River NOW
- Military-Owned Collaborative
- Creative Well Arts Foundation
- ViBe Creative District
- The Crop Foundation
- Oasis Health Group

## What Happened

We submitted our proposal in July 2024. In August, we were informed we had been downselected and invited to interview with the City.

After the interview, we were informed that the RFI had been canceled entirely. No clear public explanation was provided.

We're making our full proposal public because we believe the community deserves to see what was on the table. The 85-page proposal, financial models, partnership letters, and community survey results are all available for download.

## What We're Asking

We're not asking anyone to take sides. We're asking for transparency.

What happened to the RFI? Why was it canceled after interviews were conducted? What are the plans for 2200 Parks Avenue now?

The community showed up - 86% said they wanted something like this. We showed up with a detailed plan, proven experience, and committed partners. Understanding what happened matters, not just for us, but for how Virginia Beach makes decisions about public property.

# What Virginia Beach Needs

Virginia Beach has a talent problem. Not a lack of talent - we have plenty. The problem is keeping it.

Every year, smart, ambitious people leave Hampton Roads for DC, Richmond, Charlotte, or beyond. They're not leaving because they don't love Virginia Beach. They're leaving because they can't find the infrastructure to support their ambitions here.

## The Missing Infrastructure

When we talk about infrastructure for innovation, we're not talking about fiber optic cables or tax incentives. We're talking about the physical and social infrastructure that makes an entrepreneurial ecosystem work:

**Places to work**: Not everyone can afford a commercial lease. Not everyone wants to work from home. The middle ground - flexible workspace with community - is still scarce in Virginia Beach.

**Places to connect**: Where do you meet your co-founder? Your first investor? Your mentor? In mature ecosystems, these connections happen naturally because the infrastructure exists. In Virginia Beach, they happen despite the lack of it.

**Places to create**: Artists, makers, food entrepreneurs - they all need affordable space to do their work. Studio space. Commercial kitchens. Galleries. Performance venues.

**Places to learn**: Not classrooms - gathering spaces where knowledge gets shared informally. Where a first-time founder can learn from someone who's done it before.

## Why This Matters for Virginia Beach

Virginia Beach is at a crossroads. The city has committed to developing the Resort Area as a year-round destination, not just a summer beach town. That requires more than hotels and restaurants - it requires reasons for people to come, stay, and build.

The creative economy is growing nationally. Remote work has untethered millions of workers from geographic constraints. For the first time, people can choose where they live based on quality of life, not just job location.

Virginia Beach should be winning these people. Great weather, beach access, lower cost of living than DC or New York, strong schools. But we're competing against cities that have invested in the infrastructure we're missing.

## What We Can Learn from Bell Works

In Holmdel, New Jersey, a massive former Bell Labs building sat vacant for years. When developer Ralph Zucker reimagined it as a "Metroburb" - mixing coworking, retail, food, fitness, and community space - it became a model for suburban reinvention.

Bell Works works because it understood that people want complete experiences, not single-use buildings. They want to grab coffee, work for a few hours, take a yoga class, meet a friend for lunch, and catch an evening event - all without getting in their car.

Virginia Beach has buildings that could serve this purpose. The former MOCA building at 2200 Parks Avenue is one of them.

## Our Experience

We're not theorizing about what Virginia Beach needs. We spent seven years learning it firsthand at 1701.

We watched 750+ businesses come through our doors. We saw 40+ grow enough to graduate to their own spaces. We hosted 300+ events that brought the community together. We learned what works and what doesn't.

That experience, combined with our technology work at Port & Starboard and our hospitality experience at Fathom Coffee, is what we brought to the Arrival proposal.

## The Path Forward

Virginia Beach doesn't lack talented people or good ideas. It lacks the infrastructure to connect them.

Building that infrastructure doesn't require massive public investment. It requires vision, partnership, and the willingness to try something new.

We're ready. The community showed they're ready - 86% said they wanted something like Arrival. The question is whether Virginia Beach is ready to build the infrastructure its talent deserves.
