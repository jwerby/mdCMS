## Their Business Portfolio

Lisa and Jeff's track record extends far beyond 1701. They have built and operate multiple successful businesses that demonstrate their ability to execute complex projects across technology, hospitality, and community building.

### ADS (Advanced Drainage Systems) - Enterprise Technology

**How They Met & Their Enterprise Credentials**

Lisa and Jeff first worked together at ADS (Advanced Drainage Systems), where they implemented one of the most successful Salesforce solutions in the Aerospace and Defense industry. This enterprise-scale project established their reputation for delivering complex technology solutions.

**The Werby Tracker: Where It All Started**

Before the full Salesforce implementation, Jeff built a prototype CRM called the "Werby Tracker" - a proof-of-concept that demonstrated the business case for a comprehensive CRM solution. Built on a custom WordPress framework with jQuery, the system included reports, dashboards, and email alerts.

The results spoke for themselves: **in less than 3 months, over 20,000 sales-related activities were recorded in the system.** This adoption rate proved to leadership that the sales team needed and would use a proper CRM - paving the way for one of the most successful Salesforce deployments in the Aerospace and Defense sector.

This approach - build a scrappy prototype, prove the value with real data, then scale to an enterprise solution - reflects how Lisa and Jeff operate: practical, evidence-based, and focused on results.

Their team at **Port & Starboard** now provides solutions across multiple domains:

**Technology Services:**
- **Salesforce Implementation & Consulting** - Enterprise CRM solutions with proven success in highly regulated industries
- **Web Development** - Custom web applications and platforms
- **Mobile Application Development** - iOS and Android solutions

**Industries Served:**
- **Aerospace & Defense** - Where they built their reputation with one of the industry's most successful Salesforce implementations
- **Financial Services** - Complex compliance and workflow solutions
- **Economic Development Agencies** - A major focus area, helping regions attract and retain businesses

The ADS Salesforce implementation remains a benchmark in the Aerospace and Defense sector, demonstrating Lisa and Jeff's ability to deliver mission-critical enterprise solutions.

### Port & Starboard - Technology & Consulting

Port & Starboard is Lisa and Jeff's technology consulting firm, born from their success at ADS. The company provides:

- **Salesforce Solutions**: Implementation, customization, integration, and ongoing support
- **Web Development**: Custom websites and web applications
- **Mobile Development**: Native and cross-platform mobile apps
- **Digital Transformation**: Helping organizations modernize their technology stack

**Key Differentiators:**
- Enterprise-proven team with Aerospace & Defense credentials
- Deep expertise in Economic Development - understanding how technology can help regions grow
- Virginia Beach-based with a commitment to local economic development
- Full-stack capabilities from strategy through implementation

Port & Starboard's expertise in Economic Development agencies is particularly relevant to the Arrival vision - they understand how communities grow, what infrastructure is needed, and how to measure economic impact.

### Fathom Coffee & Roastery - Hospitality & Community

Fathom Coffee is a specialty coffee roastery that exemplifies Lisa and Jeff's approach to building community through quality experiences. Founded in 2016 and opening its storefront in November 2019, Fathom has become a cornerstone of the ViBe Creative District.

**Location & Team:**
- **Address**: 1682 Baltic Avenue, Virginia Beach (ViBe Creative District)
- **Co-founded by**: Lisa DeNoia, Jeff Werby, and Bob Werby (Jeff's father, the roaster)

**What Makes Fathom Special:**
- **Solar-roasted coffee** - A unique, sustainable roasting approach
- **21 coffees on tap** - An impressive variety of specialty brews available at any time
- **Specialty-grade focus** - Sourcing exceptional beans and bringing out their best qualities
- **Community gathering place** - More than coffee; it's where the ViBe community connects
- **Family operation** - Bob Werby brings decades of expertise as the roaster

**The Underground Coffee Shop at ADS**

One of Fathom's most innovative installations is an underground coffee shop at ADS headquarters - bringing specialty coffee culture directly into a corporate environment. This demonstrates Lisa and Jeff's ability to create unexpected, delightful experiences in unconventional spaces.

The underground coffee shop shows how Lisa and Jeff think about space activation:
- Transform underutilized areas into community gathering points
- Bring quality amenities where people already are
- Create reasons for serendipitous connection
- Build culture through shared experiences
- Prove that great hospitality can thrive anywhere

This concept is directly relevant to Arrival - it shows how Lisa and Jeff can activate unexpected spaces and bring people together through quality experiences. The proposed café and culinary component at 2200 Parks Avenue would bring this same philosophy to Virginia Beach's Oceanfront gateway.

### 1701 - Virginia Beach's First Coworking Space

1701 was the project that put Lisa and Jeff on the map as community builders in Virginia Beach. It wasn't just a workspace - it was the launchpad for Virginia Beach's entrepreneurial ecosystem.

**The Facts:**
- Virginia Beach's **first coworking space**
- Located in the **ViBe Creative District**
- Operated for **7 years**
- **750+ businesses helped** through membership, programming, and community
- **40+ businesses graduated** to their own dedicated office locations
- Hosted **300+ community events**
- Became the gathering place for Virginia Beach's entrepreneurial ecosystem

**What 1701 Proved:**
- Demand exists in Virginia Beach for quality workspace and community
- Lisa and Jeff can build, operate, and sustain a community-focused business
- The model works - 7 years of successful operation, helping hundreds of businesses grow
- Their approach produces results: 40+ businesses became successful enough to graduate to their own spaces
- They understand what entrepreneurs, freelancers, and remote workers need

**The 1701 Legacy:**
The numbers tell the story: 750+ businesses supported, 40+ graduating to their own locations. But beyond metrics, the connections made at 1701 continue to shape Virginia Beach's business community. Lisa and Jeff remain connected to the entrepreneurs they supported, and that network - along with the lessons learned - is part of what they would bring to Arrival.

1701's success led directly to Lisa being named Hampton Roads Chamber Entrepreneur of the Year and Small Business of the Year in 2018.

## Content Creation Guidelines

When writing about Arrival's features:

1. **Lead with community benefit**: "Arrival would give Virginia Beach entrepreneurs a home" not "Arrival has coworking space"
2. **Reference 1701 precedent**: Show that this model already worked in Virginia Beach
3. **Cite the survey data**: 86% approval is a powerful proof point
4. **Name the partners**: Lynnhaven River NOW, Creative Well, etc. add credibility
5. **Include financials**: $12M/5 years shows viability, not wishful thinking
6. **Connect to city goals**: Resort Strategic Growth Area, Central Beach Gateway
7. **Acknowledge what happened**: The RFI was canceled - be transparent about that

*Note: This represents what was proposed. The RFI was canceled and Arrival was not awarded the lease. The concept and team remain available for other opportunities.*
