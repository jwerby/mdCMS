## Virginia Beach Coworking Landscape

### Existing Coworking Spaces

Since 1701 closed, the Virginia Beach coworking landscape has limited options:

**Known Spaces** (research needed to confirm current status):
- Gather (Norfolk) - Closest major coworking, but not in Virginia Beach
- WeWork (if any locations in Hampton Roads)
- Regus/IWG locations (business center model)

**Gap in Market**:
After 1701's closure, Virginia Beach lacks a community-focused coworking space in the ViBe/Oceanfront area. This gap supports the case for Arrival.

## 2200 Parks Avenue - Other Interest

- Any new RFIs or RFPs for the property
- Public records about the property's future

## Comparable Models Nationally

### Bell Works (Holmdel, NJ) - Our Primary Inspiration

**Overview**:
- Former Bell Labs headquarters transformed into "Metroburb"
- Developer: Ralph Zucker / Somerset Development
- Mix of coworking, retail, food, fitness, community space

**What Makes It Work**:
- Multi-use activation - not single purpose
- Creates complete experiences (work, eat, exercise, socialize)
- Year-round programming draws consistent traffic
- Became a destination, not just a building

**Relevance to Arrival**:
Bell Works proves the Metroburb concept works. The former MOCA building at 2200 Parks Avenue has similar potential - iconic architecture, significant square footage, and location at a gateway to the Oceanfront.
